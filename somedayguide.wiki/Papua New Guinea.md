In some parts of the New Guinea highlands (**Goroka**), people engage in colorful local rituals that are called **sing-sings**. They paint themselves and dress up with feathers, pearls and animal skins to represent birds, trees or mountain spirits. Sometimes an important event, such as a legendary battle, would be enacted at such a musical festival.
