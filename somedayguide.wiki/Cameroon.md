The country name comes from a corrupted version of the Portuguese word for prawns. You can see  lots of prawns swimming up the river in **Douala** in November.

The palace of the **Fon of Bafut** is a major tourist attraction and is listed in the 2006 World Monuments Watch list of the 100 most endangered sites of 2006 by the World Monuments Fund. 

There is a beautiful waterfall at **Ekom falls**.
