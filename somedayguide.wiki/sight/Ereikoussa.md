Nice windmill. Church on hill. Chilled out. More locals then tourists.

Took long walk to this bar called Fiki. Has nice view over harbour and in a nice windy spot. Rude waiter though and nothing other than beer. Desperately craving ginger beer but nobody has it!

No dolphins spotted from boat and water not as crystal blue as expected. Scenery isn't brilliant from the boat. There are some pretty views here and those make me reminise of grass island in [Hong Kong] but its better weather here. Nice view of [Canal d'amour, Sidari, Corfu](Hong Kong] but its better weather here. Nice view of [Canal d'amour, Sidari, Corfu) right at the end!
