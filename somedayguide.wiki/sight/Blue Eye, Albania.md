the road down to the blue eye is pretty scary in a bus. it's very narrow and winding.

Blue eye lake is very green.
took a dip in the blue eye itself - very cold! after a few mins became uncomfortable.

the blue eye restaurant has the perfect position for a drink in pretty tranquil surroundings

It's very rare you get to see water like this in Europe!
