Mongolia interests me greatly. What other countries are there where maps are useless and gps coordinates are essential?

Although there is not much to see there, the inaccessibility of the place is what interests me.

**Ulaanbaatar** is the most accessible of places but the remote **Altai Tavan Bogd National Park** and **Lake Khovsgol** sound the more interesting.

The **Gobi Desert** most accessible from **Dalanzadgad** sounds especially remote.

I'm likely to visit this country one day, possibly via the **Trans-Siberian Railway**.
