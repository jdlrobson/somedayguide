La Isla Bonita aka Ambergris Caye

Manatee watching is possible here.

Note: You can also get a boat from Chetumal to at least San Pedro from where you can continue to Caye Caulker or to Belize City. Usually you can either take a morning boat or an afternoon one, and the ride costs 300-400 pesos. Notice, that if you take the afternoon boat, you will most likely need to spend a night in San Pedro as the water taxis leaving from there do not run anymore once you get there.

Pedro's Inn Backpacker Hostel: Located in beautiful Ambergis Caye, Pedro's offers the most inexpensive 
accommodation in San Pedro at $10 a night per person. Perdro's Inn is designed for people who prefer to spend 
their money on important things like partying, scuba diving, sunbathing, kayaking, windsurfing, sailing, swimming, 
snorkeling, drinking and generally having a great time rather than paying a fortune to sleep. Traveling to San Pedro, 
Belize does not need to be expensive, sometimes the discount travel option is the perfect alternative for a cheap 
vacation.
