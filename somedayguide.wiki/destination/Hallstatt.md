... as was the hiking. I went off on my own into alpine forests and found perfect repose.

.. and finally the people were awesome...
I lost my wallet here, and some young kid handed it into the city hall. A nice lady in the supermarket took me there and all 100+ euros, credit cards and driving license were still in there.
