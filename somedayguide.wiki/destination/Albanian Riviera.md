I must warn you if you go to Albania you must go with an open mind

best advert ever! I quickly booked myself in.

since this I learnt that
1) many tourists going from [Corfu, Greece](Corfu, Greece) arrive then decide Albania is not for them and do a u-turn back
2) Albania is Lonely Planet's number 1 place to visit in 2011

Albania is a former Communist country. So communist it didn't even want to be friends with other communist nations notably including the Soviet union.

To get there from Corfu you take a 80s style boat and listen to music from a similar period. right now listening to the "take those broken wings" song (forget name). Took about an hour.

really nice pebble beaches
roads still under construction
4 million population
road follows river of bulitza[sp?)to (Blue eye national park, Albania](Blue eye national park, Albania)
Ice cream about 30p! Beers £1!

A drive out of Sarande reveals there is a bit of a rubbish problem here. however hydroelectric is apparently the main source of energy in this country.
