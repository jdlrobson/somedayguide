To get here is slightly confusing. I took a bus to Cancun, and after watching the signs got off on the side of the road (not a proper bus station). From here I grabbed a cab and took a 10 minute ride down to the town itself which is off the main highway. I hear you can walk this, but there are crocodiles in the marshes you walk past.

Going back to [Cancun, Mexico](Cancun, Mexico) is easy. You just get the taxi back to the highway. A small ticket booth sells tickets to Cancun and the airport which leaves from the same side of the road.

The town itself is very pretty. It's small and quiet with one single tourist attraction other than the beach - a lighthouse that leans due to being hit by a hurricane.
