Tokyo... Tokyo... Tokyo. If only I'd grown up there. 

I left for Tokyo on the 19th February 2008. The flight itself was eventful. The nice lady at the checkin desk of Virgin Atlantic noticed my birthday was during the flight and with a wink wink nudge nudge let me go with the exciting advice to "At boarding mention there is a note for you on the system...". I did this, but the people at boarding were not so nice. They thought I was pulling a fast one when I said I believed I was to be upgraded due to the annual event that is my birthday. A quick look on the system made their jaws drop and produced a few mild expletives from the boarding team. About 10 minutes later I was seated in the usual crappy seat with no leg room on my way to Japan. The crappy seat and failed promise was obviously disappointing - but I've only flown with Virgin once since - I'd booked it already - so the jokes on them really. I was off to Japan and that was ''bloody'' exciting. I must add there was a nice rather attractive air hostess who gave me champagne on the day itself and invited me and my travel partner Paul to a "plane party" which would be featuring the pilot and other air stewardess. I'm sad to say that never happened but the day turned out all right.

I met my friend Matt at Tokyo airport and we jumped on the tube. It all became real. Yes - people do wear  face masks on the tube.

Matt took us all over the place on day 1. We saw temples. We saw shop windows with model replicas of the food that could be consumed there

and we went in cool electronic shops with massive models of Gundam.

On my birthday night we found this awesome Jack Daniels bar where this awesome barman gave us lots of complimentary celebratory shots of Jack Daniels.

He also offered these celebratory shots to everyone else in the bar.. luckily it was a small bar but we all got very drunk.

We later got invited for ramen by one of the girls. This is basically the Japanese equivalent of going to a kebab on a heavy night. As she got more drunk she seemed to forget that we couldn't speak Japanese and stopped using English. I was drunk, she was drunk and she invited me for ramen on my birthday so I tried it on with her. Luckily Matt understood enough Japanese and was able to translate that I was being too forward with my advances so that put an end to that.

Later in the trip we saw dead fish

and ate sushi fresh from the sea at the Tsukiji fish market

We saw the humourous side of the Japanese

and confirmed that yes people do eat whale.

We spent a hell of a lot of the time in Tokyo playing video games in one of the many amusement arcades. It was just so much fun. Easily my favourite city in the world to date.
