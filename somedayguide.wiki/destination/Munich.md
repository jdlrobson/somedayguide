We did lots of drinking and eating pretzels in Munich.

The Englischer Garten was great for drinking on a sunny day. It was also full of naked German's sunbathing. There was a nice stream running through the park where everyone was jumping in.

We drank and ate pretzels at Augustiner Bierhalle (https://www.augustiner-restaurant.com/html/film.html)
