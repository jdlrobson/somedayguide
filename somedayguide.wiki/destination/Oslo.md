Just checked tickets 12 weeks in advance and found a train from [Bergen, Norway] to [Oslo, Norway] leaving at 07:58 Bergen arriving at 14:32 Oslo (6 h 34 min) on https://www.nsb.no for 199 krone - a bargain £22.  It is supposed to be one of the [world's best train rides|https://www.visitnorway.com/en/Articles/Theme/Getting-here-and-around/The-worlds-best-train-ride/](Bergen, Norway] to [Oslo, Norway] leaving at 07:58 Bergen arriving at 14:32 Oslo (6 h 34 min) on https://www.nsb.no for 199 krone - a bargain £22.

Late February/March is the best time to travel in winter as days are short.

Bergen actually looks much more interesting than Oslo, so I think travelling from Oslo to Bergen might be more interesting.

Ignore the music but it gives an idea of the train journey.
