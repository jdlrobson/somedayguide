I loveeeeee Lisboa. It's so awesome.

We stayed near Rossio in [Lisbon Story Guesthouse|https://www.lisbonstoryguesthouse.com/]. It was set in a really interesting square. One morning there were lots of African people hanging around, selling fruit and chatting. There is also this great tiny shop in the square which sells drinks in the evening called [a ginjinha|https://www.panoramio.com/photo/42291662](Lisbon Story Guesthouse|https://www.lisbonstoryguesthouse.com/].

From here it was a short walk to Barrio Alto which is an interesting place to explore. A place we ate here was "Mamma Rosa" (pizza) on Rua do gremio lusitano 14 Barrio Alto. We liked the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff!

The trams were great fun. We took them all over the place.
The best ride was to the old town from near Rossio station which takes you through extemely narrow streets. like this one [from my flickr feed|https://www.flickr.com/photos/jdlrobson/5107872638/](from my flickr feed|https://www.flickr.com/photos/jdlrobson/5107872638/)

We also rode the bus/trams to Belem. There was a nice museum here, a pretty church, and yummy not to be missed egg tarts at [Casa Pasteis De Belem|https://www.pasteisdebelem.pt/](Casa Pasteis De Belem|https://www.pasteisdebelem.pt/).

Lisboa tourist card came in very handy for all this travelling about!

We took a day trip from Rossio station to [Sintra, Portugal](Sintra, Portugal) which is also thoroughly recommended. Very pretty place and great fun wondering around, and for al fresco dining. There is an amazing castle here with a fantastic view that is worth the entrance fee alone.
