My memory of LP was going to a shop in the middle of nowhere and buying a lamp, and the lady shopkeeper refusing to let me leave without taking her umbrella as she was concerned I would get wet.

I still have that umbrella, hanging in my room reminding me of how those with so little can still give so much.
