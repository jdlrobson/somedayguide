Corozal Town in Northern Belize lies on the Caribbean Sea, 9 miles from the Mexican border. It has a population of approximately 8,100, and is the capital of the district of Corozal.
Very regular buses are available between Corozal Town and Chetumal in Mexico, running about every 20 or 30 minutes during thhe day. The journey lasts about 1 hour and costs around US$1.25.

**Cerros Ruins**
Visit the Cerros Ruins across Corozal Bay. The easiest way to reach the ruins is by boat, usually hireable at the main dock east of downtown, but the site can also be reached by road. Follow the Cerros Ruins signs on the road to Copper Bank and Sarteneja, but be careful, it is a ~10-mile dirt road which can be very washed out following bad weather, especially hurricanes. The direction to Cerros may also not be terribly well marked, but if you take the left path at major forks in the road, you should find it fairly easily. Again, hiring a boat in Corozal will definitely be quicker and easier, but taking the road will give you a chance to ride one of the hand-cranked ferries seen throughout Belize (no charge for the ferry, but feel free to tip or buy juice or snacks the ferry pilots have for sale).
