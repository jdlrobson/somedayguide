Chichén Itzá Archaeological Site— The large Mayan archaeological site of Chichen Itza is nowadays one of the World's New Seven Wonders, often visited on a day trip from Cancun, but is rather distant and only a small portion of the site and attractions can be seen this way. If you find the ancient Maya of interest, spend a night at one of the hotels at Chichen so you can avoid having a rushed incomplete visit. You can take a public bus or a private vehicle, about 2 1/2 hours from [Cancun, Mexico](Cancun, Mexico) by car. Also, close to the site is a cenote, which is a fresh water sinkhole, where you can swim. The Kukulcán Pyramid is one of the most impressive Mayan structures. It is now closed off to climbing to preserve it from erosion.
