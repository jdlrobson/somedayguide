**Getting to Orange Walk**
Once you get to Chetumal bus station, like 3 PM take a cab to the ''New market'' where the buses that come to Belize Park and there get on a bus to Orange Walk Town. 
If itâ€™s about 4 PM get a taxi (you should not pay more than 80.00 Mexican pesos) to the Mexican Border and there wait for a bus to Orange Walk Town.

From the Mexican Border to Orange Walk Tow it will take you about 1.5 hours. The bus fare from Chetumal to Orange Walk is $6.00BZ or $3.00USD per person.

There be beach here but not much else. @benjam
Chetumal is quite safe. Since there are not a lot of tourists, you can easily get through a week without anyone trying to fool you. Taxi drivers don't usually try to drive you into places more expensive than what you are looking for. English is not widely spoken.

**Border fees**
The exit fee for departing Belize by land is US$18.75 (usually rounded to $19 by the border guys).
Also a small fee to leave Mexico.
Mexican tourist card MFT may be of interest

**Get in**
by road: [Cancun, Mexico] in 6hrs, [Playa del Carmen, Mexico](Cancun, Mexico] in 6hrs, [Playa del Carmen, Mexico) by in 5hrs

**Get out**
The bus station/stop at the New Market is the departure point for buses going to Belize destinations include [Corozal, Belize], [Orange Walk, Belize], [Belize City](Corozal, Belize], [Orange Walk, Belize], [Belize City) (US$1.5, US$2, US$5.5). 
To get a bus to Belize, you can either go to ADO terminal or New Market (Nueva Mercado), the latter being probably the better choice. Taxi drives usually know where New Market is, and nowadays also from where the buses leave. Bus from New Market to Belize City costs 90 pesos and runs farely often via Orange Walk where a break of 15 minutes is usually scheduled. These buses are older and have no A/C, and they stop often. Once you arrive to New Market, someone will approach you and tell about the schedules. These guys are working for the bus company and not just there to rip you off.
ADO terminal also has a service to Belize but it's less frequent and more expensive.

Boat
Note: You can also get a boat from Chetumal to at least San Pedro from where you can continue to Caye Caulker or to Belize City. Usually you can either take a morning boat or an afternoon one, and the ride costs 300-400 pesos. Notice, that if you take the afternoon boat, you will most likely need to spend a night in San Pedro as the water taxis leaving from there do not run anymore once you get there.

Most locals and Taxi drivers will know where the New Market is, even if they don't know where that bus station is. There is a service offered from the ADO terminal but it is less frequent than New Market and vastly more expensive.Just beside the border post in Chetumal is an office where you can pay your Tourist Card (IMB) whenever the border post is open, without having to go to a bank.

[Flores, Guatemala] is US$25 and buses leave from ''main'' bus station at 6.30am and 2pm.
