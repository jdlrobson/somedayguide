Tobacco Caye is a tiny island off the coast of Belize, popular with budget travelers. Hammocks, novels, group meals and a healthy dose of snorkeling are likely to fill your day, on one of the few islands that won't break the bank in a country that normally excels at doing so.

Smaller than [Caye Caulker, Belize](Caye Caulker, Belize) but more chilled out.
Dolphin's, manta rays and manatees are commonly sighted. We saw 4 dolphins off the coast and snorkling we saw an eagle ray and a stingray. We just missed seeing an octopus that had attached itself to a fishing boat's nets the night before. There were also barracudas around the reef and an osprey calls one of the huts home.

The distance from Belize City keeps people away who prefer [Caye Caulker, Belize] and [Ambergris Caye, Belize](Caye Caulker, Belize] and [Ambergris Caye, Belize). This is a great options for people on a low-moderate budget.

We stayed at Tobacco Caye Lodge for 3 nights. The island is ''extremely small'' and to be honest we regret not staying just 2 nights as we felt a bit trapped with the lack of eating options (people tend to eat in their hotels due to the size). It's a great place to just chill and enjoy the sun and sea but not much else. We played volleyball with the workers on the island every evening around 6pm. Even in just 3 days you'll get to know everyone on the island :)

Boats make the journey from Dangriga in about 20-30 minutes and charge Bz$30/person. If you're staying at Tobacco Caye Lodge or Reef's End, you can arrange a time and come on their boats for the same price, or just turn up at 8:30-9:00am at the dock and ask around at the Riverside Caf√© when a boat will be leaving (they depart from the dock directly in front of the restaurant).

From Tobacco Caye, at least one boat usually leaves around 9am each morning heading back to Dangriga. If you're interested in heading somewhere else like Glovers Reef or Thatch Caye you may be able to hire a boat to take you direct, or ride along with some snorkelers who are heading there, which saves a trip back to Dangriga.

**Get out**
Thatch Caye resort can be stayed in for US$ 351.00 per night (for 2 people)
