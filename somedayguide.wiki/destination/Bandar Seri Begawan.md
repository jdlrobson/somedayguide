BSB is an odd place.

I found it even the more stranger as at the time I was there, there was a conference going on in London about some work I did for the charity [ilga](https://ilga.org) which was effectively shaming the country for being one of the countries of the world that say homosexuality is illegal. You can see a bit of background on this project here:

So essentially I spent an entire day, logging on to the biggest gay website that could ever exist, fearing that if my wifi was tapped or twitter stream was tapped I might get in trouble with the law.

Anyway, nothing happened, so that's good but that aside, it's still a very odd place. It's a very quiet place. This is the capital of the country, and I rarely saw anyone outside. It was like walking through a small town, village even, in the UK. I was also here alone, and BSB and Brunei, are not really on the SE Asia backpackers radar. This might be due to the lack of alcohol, the cost, the lack of tubing. I wanted to learn more about this small place that no one's ever heard of.

Hostels don't really exist here. I as a result stayed in [LeGallery](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293938-d1168024-Reviews-LeGallery_Suites-Bandar_Seri_Begawan.html). For that I got a huuuge room and hugggee bed. During my stay the staff were very helpful and arranged airport pickup. It was the location however that made me choose it as it was within walking distance of the centre piece of Brunei - the impressive Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien Mosque. I did go and see this, and messed up big time by walking on some carpet with shoes on. I felt terrible. The reason I went inside was I wanted to learn more about Islam, a religion I know very little about. I tried to engage in conversation with a man inside, however he sent me to an information booth which was not in English and had no time for me. I was slightly disappointed. What was bizarre about the mosque was the contrast with everything around it. It's right next to a water village - basically lots of houses on stilts built over water. The mosque is made of gold. It was an unusual sight.

Later I went to a market, and I took a jetty ride around the river in BSB. It's the only place I've ever seen a shell garage in the middle of a body of water:

The evening I had there was the hardest. I didn't really know what to do with myself. I had some food, then in the absence of alcohol headed to a cinema on a bus, where I watched some forgettable film where Benicio del Toro was a werewolf or something. I then walked into the night market where I finally got to talk to some Bruneian people.

They were ''lovely''. They were not what I expected [one was curious about my sex life - not what you expect in a muslim country!). They were helpful - they gave me somewhere to sit down and asked about England. I asked them what I should do with myself, and they suggested shisha pipes. They knew a great place and said they'd order me a taxi. Instead 2 of the girls drove me there, and when they got there and realised it was closed, they drove me to the sultan's palace just so I could say I had seen it. They then drove me back to my hotel. Now I don't usually get into cars with strangers. I never do it in the UK, but now this was the third time I've found myself doing it during my travels (the first being (Ljubljana, Slovenia] and the second [Agematsu, Japan]. Something about travel brings out the best in me - I meet people, I gain trust and just believe in people. It might be naive, but it was a lovely experience, and a great way to end my trip to Brunei before heading off to [Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia](Ljubljana, Slovenia] and the second [Agematsu, Japan].
