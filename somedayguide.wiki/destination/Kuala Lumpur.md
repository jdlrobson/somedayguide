I flew to KL in February 2010 as part of my now [annual activity of being away from home to celebrate my birthday]. When I flew there it was my longest flight alone, and also was the start of [a trip|2010 South East Asia trip](annual activity of being away from home to celebrate my birthday]. When I flew there it was my longest flight alone, and also was the start of [a trip|2010 South East Asia trip) which would involve me travelling alone for three weeks - travelling alone is not an activity I usually do.

There was nothing special about KL. It's one of those Asian cities which is modernising rapidly. It had cheap massages, some interesting markets, some interesting animals such as frogs you could eat but I will remember it for this:

I had two visits on this trip. On the latter visit I flew in on my birthday from [Langkawi, Malaysia](Langkawi, Malaysia). I went up the sky bar.

It was a pretty nice view although drinks were very expensive. I was more attracted to the swimming pool which you can actually use in the hotel it belongs to during the day [the (Traders Hotel|https://www.shangri-la.com/en/property/kualalumpur/traders](Traders Hotel|https://www.shangri-la.com/en/property/kualalumpur/traders)) which was much cheaper and more fun to do.
