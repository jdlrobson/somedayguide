This was the highlight of our Europe trip.

Cesky Krumlov is a lovely little town with a castle next to a river.

The town itself is very medieval, and just how I imagined a Czech village to be. It's small but has enough to keep you busy whether it's drinking one of the cheap beers or having a lovely meal next to the river. There is a castle with a bear pit to explore and fantastic views over the town.

The highlight of the trip however was not the town but the river, or more precisely the thing you could do on the river. We hired a boat with 2 friends we met in the hostel and bought several cans of beer and spent 4 hours navigating down it, stopping at bars on the way and trying to avoid trees [we didn't succeed on the latter). The weather was hot, the views were brilliant, the people we met were mostly drunk. It was fun. Very fun. I'd previously been to (Vang Vieng](Vang Vieng) and this brought back good memories and was easily the closest thing I've found to the Vang Vieng experience only instead of tubes.. canoes. If you've done that. Come here. You will love it.

We stayed at [Krumlov House|https://www.krumlovhostel.com/](Krumlov House|https://www.krumlovhostel.com/) and arrived via minibus from Linz train station (in Austria) which was about 2 hours drive. There is a church on a hill a short walk from the city centre which is recommended for pretty sunsets.
