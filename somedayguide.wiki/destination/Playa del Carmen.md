We stayed in [Hostel Playa, Playa del Carmen](Hostel Playa, Playa del Carmen) - it was noisy but had hammocks and cheap :)

**1st class bus to [Chetumal, Mexico](Chetumal, Mexico)**
From Playa del Carmen, ADO express buses depart frequently to Chetumal (and there are a few ADO GL and OCC buses for a bit more money). The trip takes about 4.5 hours and costs MX$214 for Primera Class (as at June 2010). Check the ticketbus site for up to date schedules and fares.

The bus arrives at the ADO bus terminal in Chetumal, but the Mexican buses donâ€™t go into Belize, so you have to change buses in Chetumal. There are a few options for getting from Chetumal to Belize; see the next section, TRANSPORTATION BETWEEN BELIZE AND MEXICO.

Aim to get to Chetumal before 3pm to be able to get a bus direct from the New Market station in Chetumal to [Orange Walk, Belize](Orange Walk, Belize)
Based on this you should get a bus at either 07:10 (arriving 12:40) or 09:20 (arriving 13:45)
Onwards to [Orange Walk, Belize](Orange Walk, Belize) will roughly need an extra 2.5 hours. (15:10/16:15 arrival time)
