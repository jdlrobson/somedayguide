"I am just about to fall asleep. I am convinced this bed has bed bugs despite no evidence. There is a metal frame with a mattress with one sheet on it and nothing else. My mother would have a fit that there is not even a mattress cover. I have spread a slightly damp towel in the hope that this will form a layer of protection of some sort but there is not even a mosquito net so attack from mosquitos from above is more than possible."

Penang is a very pretty town. I like it a lot. Lots of old Chinese buildings, good food and some spectacular historic builders. China town's streets made me reminise of [Hoi An, Vietnam](Hoi An, Vietnam). Here I saw the biggest incense tickets I've ever seen in my life, burning outside a temple of pyromaniacs who seemed to like burning anything they could. We went to a clan house - very impressive - every walk marked with fantastic bright art work. The smells of Little India reminded me much of Singapore. Later, after Dan hired a moped we drove to a recommended restaurant... which was shut... but instead stumbled across a lion dance.

The lion was two boys in a lion costume who manipulated it so brilliantly that it brought fear and awe with every move. They climbed on to gymnastic platforms gliding and jumping from step to step. It brought me goosebumps and according to a nearby Malay a bigger one will arrive tomorrow. I found out throughout this trip that lion dances would be occurring frequently and spontaneously so on hindsight this statement didn't surprise me.

The following morning we took the bike and with the window in the hair, a law probably broken with no motorcycle license as such we were driving around Penang. We stopped at a cafe on the coast. Although this sounds glamorous the beach was pretty much road and debris. We chatted to a man on his way to work who gave us directions to a snake temple, after finishing our sticky rice with anchovies from a banana leaf we headed on our way. The snake temple was a slight disappointment, the temple had little character but lots of snakes. Adjoined to the temple was a snake zoo with 3 caged monkeys (wrong!), random rabbits (watch out for snakes), chickens and some giant tortoises. I wondered if this is where the kids were sent whilst their parents were at temple.

The snakes were pretty evil looking and all over the zoo as you would expect from a snake zoo, but most were in glass boxes. The spitting cobra was pretty evil. If you put your face in front of it and moved your head, its eyes would follow you and it would spit and lunge forward into the glass. Trust me you don't want to meet one of those outside a cage. We watched a burmese python attack a live mouse/rat. It locked its body around the poor creature and squeezed every last drop of its life. It was moving and powerful to see nature in action, with life disappear slowly as the mouse twitched its legs and give up its last bits of energy.

After a long chat with the snake keeper including a chat about how he kisses a king cobra occasionally (it has a bite that can kill you in 15 minutes). It was interesting to hear this, knowing that the nearest hospital where anti-venom was stocked was 45 minutes away. Also the snake zoo for some reason didn't seem to stock the anti-venom due to some legal reason. If one bites your arm or leg, you need to amputate to stand any chance of survival.

We drove on to some very quiet fishing villages. The houses and life seemed much more basic and fundamental then anything I'd seen in Malaysia.

We later reached Batu Feringhi after a nice breezy drive through the hills where the beaches were nicer and there were several resorts. The beaches may have had the reputation of the best on the island but I've seen better. Somewhere in the middle of nowhere we stopped off at a fish restaurant which was closed. There were young men there who worked there normally who were very hospitable. They gave us some beers and we stopped and chatted. One was an international refugee from [Myanmar](Myanmar). He couldn't speak much English but his friendliness was obvious. They told us to enjoy the beach with its terrific view and a couple of swings which we did. A hammock hung further down the beach that I would have loved to use but that would have been pushing my luck.

On our return we were heavily sunburnt. We rushed to get ready and headed for New World Park for yet another lion dance to meet some couchsurfers. We decided to get a rickshaw there, however this decision was regretted moments after boarding and some short small talk discovering that our driver was 76 years old. As he huffed and puffed, the rickshaw got slower and slower. Convinced his life was in danger, I did the right thing and offered to finish the last half of the drive. 

Amazingly, he let me.

I drove around the streets of Penang in a rickshaw with a 76 year old man cackling away, telling anyone on the streets who would look in disbelief at this sight that "I from London!" in an attempt at a cockney accent. I almost crashed us into the side of a car, but we finished un-scaved. 

Best 15 ringgit I have ever spent and he has probably ever made.

My trip to Penang ended on Chinese New Year night. During the day the streets were empty but an air of excitment and anticipation lingered. As the night began, people filled the streets, the noise of drums, fireworks and firecrackers filled the air and lion dancers spontaneously danced in even the most remote spots.
