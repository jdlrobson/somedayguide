Vang Vieng is a place where you can go and experience groundhog day.
Get up late, and eat breakfast whilst watching episodes of Friends on repeat (this continues all day and takes some adjusting too).
Get in a taxi and get dropped off at the top of a river with a tube.
Go down the river in said tube stopping and drinking at the many bars on the way down. 
Make sure you try out one of the swings at the bar to throw yourself into the browny water.
Get to the last bar where they happen to sell several "happy" things.
If you don't have one of the happy things you get off at the exit point (which is not clearly marked). You only know where to get off as there is someone from the previous day there who knows the drill. If you do have a happy thing, be careful not to go several miles too far down the river (note the route is not well marked nor lit)
From the exit point, go to a bar and ask for the menu.
Get the "happy menu" instead.
Either ask for the food menu which you meant, or continue to have happy things.
Sleep and repeat the process.

Breaking out of this process is very difficult as I found [as usually you get up around 11am which means you miss the bus to (Luang Prabang] or [Vientaine]. I had to leave behind my 2 travel buddies and their hangovers to make sure I made it. But it was well worth it. [Luang Prabang|Luang Prabang, Laos](Luang Prabang] or [Vientaine]. I had to leave behind my 2 travel buddies and their hangovers to make sure I made it. But it was well worth it. [Luang Prabang|Luang Prabang, Laos) in particular I thought was wonderful...
