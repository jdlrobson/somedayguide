Described as dodgy. Most people miss it out completely but apparently despite being dodgy it is interesting. Don't flash valuables / look like a tourist / walk alone / walk without advice. If people are being friendly here, don't trust them :)

**To [San Ignacio, Belize](San Ignacio, Belize)**
There is a bus every half hour heading west, if you are lucky you can catch an express, there are quite a few throughout the day, busses window plate will read BENQUE, get off in San Ignacio, a little town over a low lying wooden bridge that crosses the river, the bus will go left past the market and stop at the bus stop which is in the heart of town. 

**Get in/out**
from [Orange Walk, Belize](Orange Walk, Belize) it is 2hrs by bus.
from [Chetumal, Mexico](Chetumal, Mexico) 4hr by bus.
from [Caye Caulker, Belize](Caye Caulker, Belize) US$9 by boat (30-45 minutes)

Almost every day, buses leave Belize City every hour for towns to the north and west. Towns to the south, like [Dangriga, Belize] and [Placencia, Belize](Dangriga, Belize] and [Placencia, Belize), are limited to a few runs each day. The buses are comfortable and safe... and the views are spectacular.
