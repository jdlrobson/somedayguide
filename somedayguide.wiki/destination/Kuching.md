I spent my 24th birthday and the surrounding days in 2009 in Borneo in a place called Kuching.

It's a bit of an odd place as it has the most cat statues per square mile of any time I have ever seen.

Apparently it's due to the fact that Kuching means cat in Malay. As a result the city has the nickname - the Cat City. The city is not that remarkable but it's a great base for many exciting activities.

I visited Bako National Park, home of the proboscis monkey, an unusual monkey which has the slight misfortune of having something which resembles a penis as a nose.

While trekking in the jungle I encountered a scary looking scorpion (luckily dead) and a snake falling from a tree. My favourite part of the trip however was seeing the most amazing and odd creature I have ever encountered in my life. It's called the mudskipper. They were absolutely everywhere and great fun to watch as they jumped over the sea.

However you like me may remember it from the Guinness advert.

The next part of our memorable trip involved staying at [the longhouse adventure|https://www.longhouseadventure.com/](the longhouse adventure|https://www.longhouseadventure.com/) in Annah Rais.

After more trekking this time involving a small encounter with a leech and amazing scenery like this:

This was our home for the night:

Being the only visitors at the time, I got the locals to ourselves. We ended up singing to the Beatles, playing beautifully by the longhouse residents John and Rambo. We drank lots of rice brandy/wine and got very very drunk to celebrate my birthday. The lovely hosts even made me a cake.

Definitely one of the more memorable birthdays I've ever had.
