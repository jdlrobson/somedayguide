The town also bears testimony to the architectural excellence of traditional <span>Balkan</span> housing construction, which date to the late 18th and the 19th centuries. Some of the landmarks of that historical period could be seen in the Berat Castle, churches of the Byzantine era such as the Church of St. Mary of Blaherna (13th century), the Bachelors' Mosque, the National Ethnographic Museum, the Sultan's Mosque (built between 1481 and 1512), Leaden Mosque (built in 1555) and the Gorica Bridge.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mwYA\">Berat lies on the right bank of the river <span>Osum</span>, a short distance from the point where it is joined by the <span>Molisht</span> river. The old city centre consists of three parts: Kalaja (on the castle hill), Mangalem (at the foot of the castle hill) and Gorica (on the left bank of the Osum). It has a wealth of beautiful buildings of high architectural and historical interest. The pine forests above the city, on the slopes of the towering <span>Tomorr</span> mountains, provide a backdrop of appropriate grandeur. The Osumi river has cut a 915-metre deep gorge through the limestone rock on the west side of the valley to form a precipitous natural fortress, around which the town was built on several river terraces.</p>\n\n\n\n","Shkodra":"<p id=\"mwAd0\">Shkodër is an important educational and industrial center. The city produces various mechanical and electrical components, along with textile and food products. <span>Luigj Gurakuqi University of Shkodër</span> is one of the more prestigious learning centers of Albania. The public library of the city contains more than 250,000 books.\nOther cultural institutions include the Cultural Center, the Marubi Photo Archives, the Artists and Writers Association, the Migjeni Theatre (named after <span>Millosh Gjergj Nikolla</span>), the Gallery of Arts and the Museum of History.\nHistoric cultural architecture includes the <span>Castle of Shkodër</span>, the <span>Turkish Bath</span>, and the <span>Lead Mosque</span>.

They built a fort, and named it Charles Town in honour of England’s King Charles II. During this time there were frequent wars with the <span>Spanish</span>, and Charles Town was used as a base for privateering against them.  In 1684 the town was burned to the ground during the <span>Raid on Charles Town</span>.

There is a widely held misconception through which Sylhetis are usually seen as having a conservative mindset; a very inaccurate portrayal of Sylhetis and their culture, while in reality it's quite the opposite thanks to Sylheti culture's liberal and pro-plurality outlook. Sylhet is religiously very diverse, and is noted for peaceful co-existence, harmony, and mutual respect between its inhabitants of different faiths since ancient times. Sylhet has a distinct cultural and economic development, and <span>linguistic differences</span> (Greater Sylhet region was a part of Assam and Surma Valley State for much of the British Raj in comparison to the rest of Bangladesh), and given that Sylhet has, for most of its recent history, been a region of a larger entity. As so many Sylhetis are resident abroad, Sylhet has a major flow of foreign currency from non-resident Bangladeshis. The major holidays celebrated in Sylhet include traditional and religious celebrations. Cultural or nationalistic celebrations include the <span>Language Movement Day</span>, this is where wreaths are laid at the Shaheed Minar paying tribute to the martyrs, the <span>Bangladeshi Independence Day</span>, <span>Victory Day</span> celebrated with parades by school and academies, and the <span>Pohela Baishakh</span>—celebration of the Bengali New Year. Marriages are practised in a traditional sylheti Muslim style, sini faan (engagement) with the gaaye halud (haldi or turmeric ceremony), mehendi (henna ceremony) akhd (Nikah) and walima (reception) holy prayers.

Given its location, Darwin serves as a \"gateway\" for Australian travellers to Asia.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Liège":"<p id=\"mwAXo\">The city is well known for its very crowded folk festivals. The 15 August festival (\"Le 15 août\") is maybe the best known. The population gathers in a quarter named <i id=\"mwAXs\">Outre-Meuse</i> with plenty of tiny pedestrian streets and old yards. Many people come to see the procession but also to drink alcohol (mostly <span>peket</span>) and beer, eat cooked pears, <span>boûkètes</span> or sausages or simply enjoy the atmosphere until the early hours. The <span>Saint Nicholas</span> festival around 6 December is organized by and for the students of the University; for a few days before the event, students (wearing very dirty lab-coats) beg for money, mostly for drinking.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mwAd0\">Liège is the most important city of the Wallon region from an economic perspective. In the past, Liège was one of the most important industrial centres in Europe, particularly in <span>steel</span>-making. Starting in 1817, <span>John Cockerill</span> extensively developed the iron and steel industry. The industrial complex of <span>Seraing</span> was the largest in the world. It once boasted numerous <span>blast furnaces</span> and mills. Liège has also been an important centre for <span>gunsmithing</span> since the <span>Middle ages</span> and the arms industry is still strong today, with the headquarters of <span>FN Herstal</span> and <span>CMI Defence</span> being located in Liège. Although from 1960 on the <span>secondary sector</span> is going down and now is a mere shadow of its former self, the manufacture of steel goods remain important.</p>\n\n\n\n","Ganja":"<p id=\"mwAuc\">The city has many amenities that offer a wide range of cultural activities, drawing both from a rich local dramatic portfolio and an international repertoire. The city is known for its famous metal handicrafts industry during the Middle Ages. The most notable works of that period includes <span>Gates of Ganja</span> and <span>Ancient Ganja Gate</span>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mwApo\">The economy of Ganja is partially agricultural, partially tourist based, with some industries in operation. <span>Ore</span> minerals extracted from nearby mines supply Ganja's metallurgical industries, which produces copper and alumina. There are <span>porcelain</span>, silk and <span>footwear</span> industries. Other industries process food, grapes and cotton from the surrounding farmlands.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n","Moheli":"<p id=\"mwLw\">Until 1830, Mohéli was part of the <span>Ndzuwani</span> Sultanate, which also controlled the neighbouring island of <span>Anjouan</span>. In 1830, migrants from <span>Madagascar</span> led by <span>Ramanetaka</span>, who later changed his name to Abderemane, took over the island and established the sultanate of Mwali. In the mid-nineteenth century its ruler was <span>Queen Jumbe-Souli</span>.

It also going back to the time of <span>Dilmun</span> some 5,000 years ago, but it came to prominence in the historical records during the era of <span>Tylos</span> when Bahrain came under domination of the <span>Selucid Greeks</span>, and Muharraq was the centre of a pagan cult dedicated to the shark god, <span>Awal</span>. The city's inhabitants, who depended upon <span>seafaring</span> and trade for their livelihood, worshipped Awal in the form of a large statue of a shark located in the city.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mwLg\"><span>Gulf Air</span> has its headquarters in Muharraq, and <span>Bahrain Air</span> formerly had its headquarters in the Mohamed Centre in Muharraq.</p>","Mons":"<p id=\"mw8g\">The centre consists largely of red brick houses. Although there are few old buildings and rarely new blue stone buildings, its use is generally limited to parts of the decorative walls. Much of the centre is made up of houses which are two or three storeys high. \nIn commercial areas, the ground floor is used as commercial space, while other floors are used for housing. Generally behind the houses there is a small garden.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Anjouan":"<p id=\"mwqg\">African mainlanders, Creoles, <span>Arabs</span>, <span>Malay</span>-<span>Polynesians</span>, <span>Antalotes</span> and <span>Shirazis</span> make up the population of Anjouan. The main religion is <span>Sunni Islam</span>. Although the island is filled with large numbers of mosques, religious observance is not as strict as it is in many other countries observing Islam. Alcohol is forbidden to Muslims.</p>\n<p id=\"mweA\">Anjouan is part of the <span>Comoros Islands</span> located in the Mozambique Channel. It consists of the eroded remains of a large <span>shield volcano</span> that formed in the <span>Pleistocene</span> epoch. Eruptions from <span>fissure vents</span> spanned in three directions, followed by a long interval of erosion. Renewed <span>volcanism</span> produced a series of lava flows that filled deep valleys and flooded areas along the coast.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n","Cres":"<p id=\"mwMQ\">Cres has been inhabited since the Paleolithic time period. Its name predates <span>classical antiquity</span> and is derived from <span>Proto-Indo-European</span> <i id=\"mwNA\">*(s)quer-</i> (\"cliff\"). Although this is one view, another more historically correct is from classical antiquity, when the town was founded and inhabited by ancient Greeks, and called it Chersos (Χέρσος); \"chersos\" in Greek means \"barren land\", \"uncultivated land\" and \"dry heaths\". Later, \"Chersos\" was resounded to \"Cresta\", from which eventually the modern name \"Cres\" is derived.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Polotsk":"<p id=\"mwLw\">Polotsk is one of the most ancient cities of the <span>Eastern Slavs</span>.

The 8th century <span>St. Pancras</span> Church, the 20th century <span>Bouvier-Washer Cité</span> and its Salesian monastery are popular attractions for tourists.

It was constructed in the 1140s as a pagan church, rebuilt in the 14th and 17th centuries as <span>Roman Catholic Church</span>, repaired in 1883 and destroyed by the Communist administration in 1961.

Between <span>Lentos Art Museum</span> and the \"Brucknerhaus\", is the \"Donaulände\", which is also referred to as \"Kulturmeile\" (\"culture mile\"). This is a park alongside the river, which is used mainly by young people to relax and meet in summer. It is also used for the <span>Ars Electronica Festival</span> in early September and the \"Stream Festival\", which takes place annually. In June, July and August the \"Musikpavillon\" is placed in the park where musical groups of different styles perform on Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays free of charge. <br id=\"mwApg\">\nLinz has other culture institutions, such as the Posthof, which is near the harbour, and the <span>Stadtwerkstatt</span>, which is by the River Danube.

For centuries, the port city has been a <span>melting pot</span> for people from all over the world. Its historic trade networks have left a lasting impact on its language, culture and cuisine. The <span>Chittagonian language</span> has many Arabic, Persian, English and Portuguese loanwords. The immensely popular traditional feast of <i id=\"mwAn4\">Mezban</i> features the serving of hot beef dish with white rice. The cultivation of pink <span>pearls</span> is a historic activity in Chittagong. Its Mughal-era name, <i id=\"mwAoI\">Islamabad</i> (City of Islam), continues to be used in the old city. The name was given due to the port city's history as a gateway for early Islamic missionaries in Bengal. Notable Islamic architecture in Chittagong can be seen in the historic Bengal Sultanate-era Hammadyar Mosque and the Mughal fort of Anderkilla. Chittagong is known as the <i id=\"mwAoM\">Land of the Twelve Saints</i> due to the prevalence of major Sufi Muslim shrines in the district. Historically, <span>Sufism</span> played an important role in the spread of Islam in the region. Prominent <span>dargahs</span> include the mausoleum of Shah Amanat and the shrine of <span>Bayazid Bastami</span>. The Bastami shrine hosts a pond of <span>black softshell turtles</span>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mwqA\"><span>Stone age</span> fossils and tools unearthed in the region indicate that Chittagong has been inhabited since <span>Neolithic</span> times.

The city has a total area of 414.65 square kilometres (160.1 sq mi), making it the largest city in Austria by area.</p>\n\n","Melbourne":"<p id=\"mwA0o\">Melbourne is an international cultural centre and the city serves as Australia's cultural capital, with prominent offerings in the form of major events and festivals, drama, musicals, comedy, music, art, architecture, literature, film and television. The climate, waterfront location and nightlife make it one of the most vibrant destinations in Australia. For seven years in a row (from 2011 to 2017) it held the top position in a survey by <i id=\"mwA00\"><span>The Economist Intelligence Unit</span></i> of the <span>world's most liveable cities</span>, partly due to its broad cultural offerings. The city celebrates a wide variety of annual cultural events and festivals of all types, including Australia's largest free community festival—<span>Moomba</span>, the <span>Melbourne International Arts Festival</span>, <span>Melbourne International Film Festival</span>, <span>Melbourne International Comedy Festival</span> and the <span>Melbourne Fringe Festival</span>. The culture of the city is an important drawcard for tourists, of which 2.7 million international and 8.9 million domestic travellers arrived in 2017.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mwAc0\">Melbourne is in the southeastern part of mainland Australia, within the state of <span>Victoria</span>. Geologically, it is built on the confluence of <span>Quaternary</span> lava flows to the west, <span>Silurian</span> <span>mudstones</span> to the east, and <span>Holocene</span> sand accumulation to the southeast along <span>Port Phillip</span>.

Phuntsholing is uniquely more urban than other Bhutanese towns as it is the Bhutan financial, industrial and trading capital. It has been affected a little by the neighbouring culture, but is distinctly far more quiet and orderly than its neighbour.</p>\n<p id=\"mwHg\">On 5 April 1964, reformist <span>Prime Minister</span> <span>Jigme Dorji</span> was assassinated in Phuntsholing by monarchist cadres as the king lay ill in Switzerland. The <span>Dorji family</span> was subsequently put under close watch. It was 1958 when the first one-storeyed cottage was constructed to house a shop. The late <span>Prime Minister</span>, <span>Jigme Dorji</span> informed Phuentsholing residents that concrete houses could be constructed.\nTashi group of companies constructed the first concrete house, followed by Tibetans and Indians.  Some of the structures that exist to this day are the buildings housing Bhutan Enterprise, Jatan Prasad Lal Chand Prasad shop and a beauty parlour near Zantdopelri lhakhang. After the announcement, 18 shops were built around Zangdopelri area. The Zangdopelri area was a bus terminal, and on Saturday a market would be assembled. Apart from the cottages, there were several huts and Phuentsholing was beginning to grow.</p>","Quime":"<p id=\"mwFA\">Quime's economy is based on agriculture and the extraction of minerals.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n","Sønderborg":"<p id=\"mwGQ\">The town of Sønderborg is home to <span>Sønderborg Castle</span> (<i id=\"mwGw\">Sønderborg Slot</i>), the <span>Royal Danish Army</span>'s Sergeant School (until 2013) and <span>Sandbjerg Estate</span> (<i id=\"mwHg\">Sandbjerg Gods</i>). Sønderborg castle is in the centre of the town, and houses a museum focusing on the history and culture of the area.  The museum is open all year. Sandbjerg Estate, which had belonged for many years to the Dukes of Sønderborg, and then to the Reventlow family, was donated to <span>Aarhus University</span> in 1954.

Traditional legends state that the town was founded by Do-Aklin, a son of the king of <span>Allada</span> who ventured north to found his own kingdom; the name is thought to come from Danhomé, meaning 'belly of Dan', Dan been the original chief of the village. Dahomey expanded rapidly in the 1700s, absorbing many of the surrounding kingdoms, and growing rich from the slave trade. After several attempts the French conquered the kingdom on 16 November 1892, prompting King <span>Béhanzin</span> to torch the city and flee northward. Thereafter the town declined in importance, a process hastened when the French built the new administrative centre of <span>Bohicon</span> immediately to the east. Today, the city is of less importance, but is still popular with tourists and as a centre for <span>crafts</span>.</p>","Grand Comore":"<p id=\"mwHg\">For several centuries, Grande Comore was divided into a number of <span>sultanates</span>, including Bambao, Itsandra, Mitsamihuli, <span>Mbajini</span>, Hambuu, Washili, Hamahame, Mbwankuu, Mbude and Domba. The sultans were also known as <i id=\"mwIQ\">mfaume</i>. In 1886, the ruler of <span>Bambao</span>, Sultan <span>Said Ali bin Said Omar</span> declared a \"state of Ngazidja\", usurping the other sultanates and accepting a French protectorate over the island. In 1893, Sultan Said Ali was sent into exile on <span>Réunion</span>. In 1908, France annexed the island and the sultanates were abolished.

The Savuti Marsh is the relic of a large inland <span>lake</span> whose water supply was cut a long time ago by <span>tectonic movements</span>. Nowadays the marsh is fed by the erratic Savuti Channel, which dries up for long periods then curiously flows again, a consequence of tectonic activity in the area. It is currently flowing again and in January 2010 reached Savuti Marsh for the first time since 1982. As a result of this variable flow, there are hundred of dead trees along the channel's bank. The region is also covered with extensive <span>savannahs</span> and rolling <span>grasslands</span>, which makes wildlife particularly dynamic in this section of the park. During <span>dry seasons</span>, tourists going on <span>safari</span> often sight <span>rhinoceros</span>, <span>common warthog</span>, <span>kudu</span>, <span>impala</span>, <span>zebra</span>, <span>wildebeest</span> and herds of <span>African bush elephant</span>.

A monastery was first built on the site by Padma Sambhava at the beginning of the tenth century, but it was not until 1644 that <span>Ngawang Namgyal</span> built a larger monastery on the old foundations; for centuries this imposing five-storey building served as an effective defence against numerous invasion attempts by the <span>Tibetans</span>.</p>\n\n\n\n","Maun":"<p id=\"mwTQ\">The 7th leg of the 22nd installment of the US television program <span>The Amazing Race</span> is focused on what happens to the race participants while in and around Maun.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mwEg\">The settlement was founded in 1915 as the tribal capital of the <span>Batawana</span> people, it has had a reputation as a hard-living 'Wild West' town helping the local cattle ranching and hunting operations. However, with the growth of the tourism industry and the completion of the tar road from <span>Nata</span> in the early 1990s, Maun has developed swiftly, losing much of its old town character. It is now home to over 30,000 people.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Punta Gorda (Belize)":"<p id=\"mwNg\">There are several hotels in Punta Gorda that draw tourists with their ocean views. Punta Gorda is also a gateway to several well-regarded jungle accommodations, including <span>Cotton Tree Lodge</span>, The Lodge at Big Falls, Copal Tree Lodge, and Hickatee Cottages. Every May the town hosts the Toledo Cacao Festival, held over the Commonwealth Day holiday weekend, which celebrates Toledo district's ancient and modern-day links with cacao and chocolate.</p>","Gabrovo":"<p id=\"mwfw\">Internationally known as a centre of <span>humour</span> and <span>satire</span>, Gabrovo has two theatres, the Racho Stoyanov Drama Theatre and the puppet theatre, a <span>House of Humour and Satire</span> that serves as a cultural institute, a centre, museum and gallery to popularise comic art.

Both eras left visible landmarks such as the <span>forts of Corral Bay</span> and the German-style wood houses. The governments of Spain and Germany currently maintain honorary <span>consulates</span> in Valdivia. The city is commonly seen as a tourist magnet in Chile, and sometimes described as <i id=\"mwAW0\">La Perla del Sur</i> (<i id=\"mwAW4\">The Pearl of the South</i>) and as <i id=\"mwAW8\">La ciudad mas linda de Chile</i> (<i id=\"mwAXA\">Chile's most beautiful city</i>).\nEvery year during the summer months of January and February the municipality organizes many free cultural events along the river site, such as concerts, sporting events, and other entertainment. To mark and celebrate the end of the touristic summer months, halfway through February all entertainment reaches its climax with the celebration of <i id=\"mwAXE\">noche Valdiviana</i> (Valdivian night). During this night many local groups and communities present themselves on boats during a night parade over the river. Every boat has its own theme related with one theme of that year. At the end a jury picks the winners in different categories. The parade is by tradition started by a boat which presents <i id=\"mwAXI\">la reina de los ríos</i>. In recent years Valdivians have showed an increasing interest in nature and <span>ecotourism</span>. An example of this was the formation of <i id=\"mwAXQ\"><span>Acción por los Cisnes</span></i> an ecologist group formed to protect black-necked swans and the natural environment that surrounds the city, particularly wetlands created or expanded by the <span>Great Chilean earthquake</span>. With the founding of <span>Universidad Austral</span> in 1954 and the arrival of the <span>CECS</span> research center, Valdivia is now considered a major research center in Chile, particularly in areas related to nature such a <span>glaciology</span> and <span>ecology</span>. The <span>Great Chilean earthquake</span> and the national government's creation of the <span>Los Lagos Region</span> were difficult for Valdivian society. Valdivians resented to be punished first by a major earthquake and then by being placed under the administration of what they perceived to be a less-deserving city, <span>Puerto Montt</span>. The recent creation of a new, smaller, but more independent region (Los Ríos), with Valdivia as its capital, reduced the previous stigma.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mwAkE\">The city and commune of Valdivia rely heavily on <span>silviculture</span>, the <span>pulp and paper industry</span> and other forestry-related activities (the harvesting and processing of wood from nearby plantations of <span>eucalyptus</span> and <span>Douglas firs</span>). Large businesses such as <span>CELCO</span>, <span>Bomasil</span> and <span>Louisiana-Pacific</span> have established wood processing factories near Valdivia. <span>Metallurgy</span>, <span>naval construction</span> and repairs are also important industries, with the companies of <span>Asenav</span> and Alwoplast based in the area. <span>Agroforestry</span>/<span>agriculture</span>, <span>livestock</span>, <span>aquaculture</span> and <span>food processing</span> are lesser but also important industries that contribute to the region's economy. The <span>chocolate</span> company (<span>Entrelagos</span>) contributes to the image of the region, as does the <span>brewing</span> industry, a symbol of the area and another important part of the local economy, with <span>Kunstmann</span> the most famous brewery in Valdivia. <span>Beer</span>, along with <span>cold cut</span> meat and <span>sausages</span>, is part of the city's German heritage and is preserved as part of the local heritage. Trade, restaurants and hotels link to the tourism industry which represent an important part in Valdivia's growing economy.</p>\n\n","Jakar":"<p id=\"mwhg\">Jakar, like the rest of <span>Bumthang District</span> and its neighbors, is culturally part of eastern Bhutan. While <span>Dzongkha</span> is the national language of administration and instruction, local languages include <span>Bumthang</span> and <span>Brokkat</span>. Jakar is famous throughout Bhutan for its distinctive and brightly colored woven wool items called <i id=\"mwiw\">yethra</i>.</p>\n<p id=\"mwgg\">Being located in the spacious and tree covered <span>Bumthang (Choekhor) Valley</span>, the area is also a popular tourist destination, and consequently the town is served by several good quality hotels and craft shops. there are so many guest houses.</p>\n\n","Pereira":"<p id=\"mweg\">Pereira is known nationally for being an important city for tourism, attracting visitors as it is the center of the Coffee Cultural Landscape as named by UNESCO. Pereira has several landmarks which attract tourists, such as the Bolivar Statue, the Viaduct, and its many open-air swimming pools and recreational parks. <span>Lake Otún</span> and <span>Santa Isabel</span> provide destinations for sports adventure tourism. Pereira also has a night life scene with bars and nightclubs, located mostly on Circunvalar Avenue. Pereira is also a health destination, with many clinics housing health care specialists, as well as esthetic clinics. The city is also the most common setting for two Colombian soap operas on Netflix: Sin Senos No Hay Paraiso, and the sequel Sin Senos, Si Hay Paraiso. It's also very close to Cocora Valley (Valle de Cocora in Spanish) which is around 45 minutes drive from Pereira and famous for its giant palm trees visited by all types of domestic and international tourists every year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mwQw\">The history of the city goes back to the <span>pre-Columbian era</span>, in which the current city area was inhabited by the Quimbaya and Pijao cultures, widely recognized for their goldsmiths. In this region, Marshal Jorge Robledo founded the city of Carthage on August 9, 1540, but due to the siege of the pijaos or reasons of economic expediency this city was moved in 1691 to the site that currently occupies the north end of the Valley of the Cauca, towards the banks of the La Vieja river. The original site became jungle again and buried the remains of civilization. On the few ruins of the Spanish population, crossed by the route that led from Valle del Cauca to Medellín, through Manizales, a group of 20 Antioqueno families had already built their homes when a handful of Vallecaucanos appeared to find the population of Carthage La Vieja, today Pereira. Although the formal foundation came from the Caucano group, the emergence of Pereira was another chapter of the Antioqueno colonization, and the contribution of other social groups such as the Caucano was in its beginning relatively scarce.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Iquique":"<p id=\"mwIw\">Although the city was founded in the 16th century, there is evidence of habitation in the area by the <span>Chango</span> people as early as 7,000 BC. During colonial times, Iquique was part of the <span>Viceroyalty of Peru</span> as much of South America was at the time, and remained part of <span>Peruvian</span> territory until the end of the 19th century. Iquique's early development was due in large part to the discovery of mineral riches, particularly the presence of large deposits of <span>sodium nitrate</span> in the <span>Atacama Desert</span> (then part of Peruvian territory).</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mwZg\">Iquique has one of the largest duty-free commercial port centers of South America, the <span>Zona Franca of Iquique</span> (free zone of Iquique) which has been traditionally called <i id=\"mwaA\">Zofri</i>.

Clay pots are everywhere, some as small as a hand, some large enough for two people to stand up in, either as <span>monuments</span> or for real use. A local legend is that if you drink water from a \"tinajon\", you will stay in Camagüey. (Quien tome agua del tinajón, en Camagüey se queda). Meaning that if you meet a Camagüayense girl, you will fall in love with her and never leave.The main secondary education institutions are the <span>University of Camagüey</span> and the Instituto Pedagógico de Camagüey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mwJg\">Located on a <span>plain</span> in the middle of its province, the municipality borders with <span>Vertientes</span>, <span>Florida</span>, <span>Esmeralda</span>, <span>Sierra de Cubitas</span>, <span>Minas</span>, <span>Sibanicú</span> and <span>Jimaguayú</span>.</p>","Concepción":"<p id=\"mwOQ\">Concepción was founded by <span>Pedro de Valdivia</span> in 1550 north of the <span>Bío Bío River</span>, at the site which is today known as <span>Penco</span>. At that time it was given the name <i id=\"mwPw\">Concepción de María Purísima del Nuevo Extremo</i> (Mary Immaculate Conception of the New End). The new settlement of Concepción was just a few kilometers north of <i id=\"mwQA\"><span>La Frontera</span></i> (The Frontier), the boundary between <span>Spanish</span> territory and the land of the <span>Mapuche</span>, an American Indian ethnic group that remained independent until the 1870s. The settlement was formally recognized by the Spanish authorities as a town two years later by a royal decree. It was given a coat-of-arms that is still in use today.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mwAZE\">Historically characterized by a strong manufacturing industry, Concepción has also been a major center for distribution and services and the financial basis of the regional economy.</p>\n\n","Pirin National Park":"<p id=\"mwOA\">Pirin National Park was established on 18 November 1962 in order to preserve the natural ecosystems and landscapes along with their plant and animal communities and habitats. Originally named <b id=\"mwPQ\">Vihren National Park</b>, the protected area initially covered 67.36<span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" id=\"mwPg\">&nbsp;</span>km. Its territory was expanded several times until it reached its current area of 403.56<span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" id=\"mwQA\">&nbsp;</span>km in 1999. In 1983, Pirin National Park was added to the list of <span>UNESCO</span> <span>World Heritage Sites</span> as an area of outstanding natural importance.

At the time, the estuary of <span>Wouri River</span> was known as the Rio dos Camarões (Shrimp River). By 1650, it had become the site of a town formed by immigrants, said to have arrived from Congo, who spoke the <span>Duala language</span>.

Those traveling into Tibet must specify every location they want to travel within the TAR, and thus cannot travel anywhere not specified in the application. Before entering on a train, plane, or road leading into Tibet, anyone without a Chinese passport must present the Tibet Entry Permit, or they will otherwise be denied entry.

This park, along with the other two reserved parks within the larger Sangha Reserve, is secluded from all economic activity involving roads and human interference, which has resulted in its maintenance as a pristine rain forest. The park lies within the forest area of Congo which forms 11% of the total area of the country.

The island was first sighted by Europeans in 1494 during <span>Christopher Columbus</span>'s <span>second voyage</span> to the <span>New World</span>. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Dolisie":"<p id=\"mwDQ\">The city was founded as a station on the <span>Congo-Ocean Railway</span>, and it was named after <span>Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza</span>'s lieutenant <span>Albert Dolisie</span>.\nIt became a thriving city thanks to the wealth of the railway, and it had 20,000 inhabitants in 1972. The city's name changed to Loubomo in 1975, and soon it became the third largest city in Congo-Brazzaville. The <span>civil war of the late 1990s</span> caused an exodus of rural people towards cities, and Loubomo's population has significantly increased since then.</p>\n<p id=\"mwEw\">Dolisie is a major rail center.  Its location marks the link between the east-west <span>Congo-Ocean Railway</span> and the Mbinda line which runs north to the border with <span>Gabon</span> at <span>Mbinda</span>.\nDolisie is also home to numerous small industries (wood, lumber).</p>","Bouaké":"<p id=\"mwOw\">Bouaké was established as a French military post in 1899 and has been an administrative center since 1914.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mwYQ\">Tobacco products, building materials, and textiles are produced, and <span>cotton</span> sisal and rice are processed. Gold, mercury, and manganese are found nearby.  The overall economy was shaken during the near decade long rebel rule that started in 2002.  Many companies either shut down or relocated to Abidjan, Ivory Coast’s coastal economic hub.  These events resulted in the 60% reduction in formal employment.  For example, the city’s biggest textile mill, the Gonfreville Establishment, saw an employment decrease of 1200 workers, an 80% reduction. Economic recovery was slow until the early 2010s.  After the State took back control of Bouake after the 2010-2011 election, the economy moved into a state of reconstruction.  Roads were repaved after years of neglect, which allowed the transportation of goods to become an easier task.  Cash crops such as cotton and cashews started to be transported in higher quantities to be processed in Bouake.  Singapore-based Olam opened a cashew processing plant in Bouake in 2012, which accounts for nearly 2400 jobs.  The agribusiness as a whole is beginning to turn to its original state before the rebel conflict.  Additionally, banks have opened new branches and supermarkets have returned to normal operation.  The government is stimulating this regrowth through policies, such as price floors, and projects to increase trade, including the construction of a highway to connect Bouake to the nation’s capital, Yamoussoukro.</p>","Garamba National Park":"<p id=\"mwEA\">Garamba National Park was established in 1938 and covers an area of a <span about=\"#mwt13\" typeof=\"mw:Transclusion\" data-mw=\"{&quot;parts&quot;:[{&quot;template&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;Convert&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;./Template:Convert&quot;},&quot;params&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;4900&quot;},&quot;2&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;km2&quot;},&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;sqmi&quot;},&quot;abbr&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;on&quot;}},&quot;i&quot;:0}}]}\" id=\"mwEQ\">4,900</span><span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" about=\"#mwt13\">&nbsp;</span><span about=\"#mwt13\">km</span><span about=\"#mwt13\"> (1,900</span><span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" about=\"#mwt13\">&nbsp;</span><span about=\"#mwt13\">sq</span><span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" about=\"#mwt13\">&nbsp;</span><span about=\"#mwt13\">mi)</span> in northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.

They still inhabit the forests of the south and east provinces. Bantu speakers originating in the Cameroonian highlands were among the first groups to move out before other invaders. During the late 1770s and early 1800s, the Fulani—a pastoral Islamic people of the western Sahel—conquered most of what is now northern Cameroon, subjugating or displacing its largely non-Muslim inhabitants.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mwUw\">Most of Yaoundé's economy is centred on the administrative structure of the civil service and the diplomatic services.

The first mention of Moravian Ostrava (Moravská Ostrava) in 1267 describes it as a township. Ostrava grew on the banks of the Ostrá River (now the <span>Ostravice</span>), from which it took its name. This river still divides the city into two main parts: Moravian Ostrava (Moravská Ostrava) and Silesian Ostrava (Slezská Ostrava). The settlement occupied a strategic position on the border between the two historical provinces of <span>Moravia</span> and <span>Silesia</span>, and on the ancient <span>trade route</span> from the <span>Baltic Sea</span> to the <span>Adriatic</span> known as the <span>Amber Road</span>. This location helped the town to grow and flourish. However, Ostrava began to decline in importance after the <span>Thirty Years' War</span>, when it was occupied by Swedish forces from 1621–1645.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Parakou":"<p id=\"mwWg\">The city has a museum, the <span>Musée en Plein Air de Parakou</span>.</p>\n<p id=\"mwEA\">The foundation of the city dates back to the 16th century by traders.</p>","Bangassou":"<p id=\"mwFQ\">During the French colonial occupation of <span>Congo Free State</span>, the French military established a base at Bangassou.

Stanley placed a large \"Equator Stone\" near the riverbank south of the city to mark the point where he believed the equator crossed the river. It remains there today. Due to its symbolic location close to the equator and the Congo River, there were early plans to locate the capital of the <span>Congo Free State</span> in Mbandaka, but they never came off the drawing board. These plans included <span>infrastructure</span> for an estimated population of 100,000 people, a train station, a Catholic cathedral, a governor's residence, and a palace for future visits of <span>Leopold II of Belgium</span>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Laguna San Rafael National Park":"<p id=\"mwFQ\">Non-indigenous people first explored the area of Laguna San Rafael in the year 1675.

By 1916, the military conquest of Chad was completed, however movements of resistance to the colonial regime took place. It was especially in the southwest of the country that dissensions continued until about 1930. He decided to found the post of Moundou in the centre of the rebellious zone. The rebellious situation did not change much with the arrival of Lieutenant Robert Reverdy. Chief of the district of the Middle Logone in 1925, Reverdy, who became a director in 1927, completed an uninterrupted stay for five years and eight months. He moved the chief town of the district to Moundou in 1927.

The city was also known as <i id=\"mwzg\">La Coquette</i> (the beautiful city) in the 1970s.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Manaus":"<p id=\"mwAoY\">Because of Manaus' location next to the <span>Amazon rainforest</span>, it attracts a substantial number of Brazilian and foreign tourists, who come to see wildlife on land and in the rivers.

It is located along the south bank of the <span>Congo River</span>, downstream on the <span>Pool Malebo</span> and directly opposite the city of <span>Brazzaville</span>, capital of the Republic of the Congo. The Congo river is the second longest river in Africa after the <span>Nile</span>, and has the continent's greatest <span>discharge</span>. As a <span>waterway</span> it provides a means of transport for much of the Congo basin; it is navigable for river barges between Kinshasa and <span>Kisangani</span>; many of its tributaries are also navigable. The river is an important source of <span>hydroelectric power</span>, and downstream from Kinshasa it has the potential to generate power equivalent to the usage of roughly half of Africa's population.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n","Sihanoukville":"<p id=\"mwA64\">The majority of municipal inhabitants are of East Asian descent, who profoundly characterize and influence local customs, moral, commerce, cuisine and tradition based on pan-East Asian beliefs and ideas. <span>Cambodian culture</span> is of distinct ancient <span>Khmer</span> origin, accompanied by century-old moderate Chinese and Vietnamese cultural influences. The prolonged presence of foreign and in particular Westerners in Cambodia and Sihanoukville town contributes to a noticeable varied, modern, multi-cultural manifestation, which is increasingly influenced by modern media.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mwAd0\">Sihanoukville was established as an international marine gateway and as a result the local economy is largely defined by its deep water port and the nearby <span>oil terminal</span>. Attached is a regularly modernized cargo storage and <span>logistics</span> facility which serves numerous shipping companies, freight forwarders, suppliers, and maintenance contractors. All of these are based in the port's vicinity. The Phnom Penh–Sihanoukville transport corridor is the premier national trade route, accounting for about 75 percent of Cambodia's trade traffic.</p>\n\n\n\n","Nicosia":"<p id=\"mwAno\">The <span>Cyprus Museum</span> in Nicosia is the largest and oldest archaeological museum in Cyprus.

Over the last 2,000 years, <span>Amerindians</span> migrating through the islands settled the area attracted by the nearby river. With the arrival of the <span>Europeans</span> in the 16th and 17th centuries, a small settlement was established by the <span>French</span> who, in their tradition of naming places after what they found there, used their name for the river reeds that grew along the banks. A plan was created for the settlement that mirrored examples in France where streets extended from a central point — what is today the Old Market — and spread out to the rest of the settlement.</p>\n\n\n\n","Hvar":"<p id=\"mwWQ\">The island of Hvar is located in the <span>Adriatic Sea</span>, off the <span>Dalmatian</span> coast. To the north, the island of <span>Brač</span> lies across the Hvar Channel (<i id=\"mwXQ\">Hvarski kanal</i>), to the west is <span>Vis</span>, separated by the Vis Channel, and to the south <span>Korčula</span> lies across the Korčula Channel, while the <span>Pelješac</span> Peninsula is across the Neretva Channel.

The Hvar Culture lasted from 3500 to 2500 B.C. Beginning in the 4th century BC, the <span>Greeks</span> colonized the island. In 384 BC the Greek colonisers of Pharos defeated <span>Iadasinoi</span> warriors and their allies, invited by the Hvar indigenes in their resistance to the Greek colonization. Their victory over much larger forces was immortalized in one of the oldest known inscriptions of Croatia. Following Roman victory in the <span>Second Illyrian War</span> against <span>Demetrius of Pharos</span>, the island became a part of the <span>Roman Republic</span> in 219 BC and the Greek name Pharos was changed to Pharia. After the fall of the <span>Roman Empire</span> in the west, the island was under the control of the <span>Byzantine</span> or Eastern Roman Empire. The population increased in the <span>Late Antiquity</span> with an abundance of archeological finds. A large number of new <span>villa rustica</span> in Stari Grad Plain and also on the previously vacant eastern shores was built.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n","Kisangani":"<p id=\"mwARA\">The city is a centre for television productions, radio, theatre, film, <span>multimedia</span> and print publishing. Kisangani's many cultural communities have given it a distinct local culture. The city's waterfront allure and nightlife has attracted residents and tourists alike. As a Central African city, Kisangani shares many cultural characteristics with the rest of the continent. It has a tradition of producing African <span>jazz</span>, nu-rumba, African folk, <span>rumba</span> and <span>ndombolo</span> music. The city has also produced much talent in the fields of <span>visual arts</span>, theatre, music, and dance. Some of its better known popular culture residents include Aberti Masikini, <span>Anne-Sylvie Mouzon</span>, <span>Barly Baruti</span>, <span>Koffi Olomide</span> and Moreno. Yet, being at the African confluence of the South and the North and West and East traditions, Kisangani has developed a unique and distinguished cultural face. Another distinctive characteristic of Kisangani culture life is to be found in the animation of its downtown, particularly during summer, prompted by cultural and social events, particularly festivals. The city's largest festival is the Cercle Boyoma Culture festival, which is the largest in the world of its kind. Other popular festivals include the Kisangani Jazz Festival, Kisangani Film Festival, Nuits d'Afrique and the Kisangani Fireworks Festival.</p>\n\n\n<p id=\"mwmg\">Kisangani is strategically placed at the junction of the <span>Congo</span>,\nTshopo, and Lindi rivers and at the crossroads between eastern and western Congo. Approximately central of the African continent, it is located in North-eastern <span>Democratic Republic of the Congo</span> (DRC), central of <span>Tshopo Province</span>. The location at the northernmost tip of the <span>Congo River</span>, navigable for large waterborne cargo between <span>Kinshasa</span> and Kisangani, which feeds into a naturally transportation waterway for much of the <span>Congo Basin</span>, has helped the city grow in significance as a trading city.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Moroni (Comoros)":"<p id=\"mwQg\">The city is on the western coast of <span>Ngazidja</span>. Moroni has a rocky volcanic coastline, mostly without beaches.

The earliest written evidence for settlement in the Comoros Islands comes no earlier than the 7th century, possibly by Arab navigations and Bantu-speaking agriculturalists, while ceramic finds from the 7th to 10th century demonstrate that the Islands were part of the developing <span>Swahili</span> civilization, but when Moroni itself was first settled is not known. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n","Baños":"<p id=\"mwKg\">Baños is located on the northern <span>foothills</span> of the <span>Tungurahua</span> volcano.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mwHw\">The city is also a <span>Roman Catholic</span> religious center, as some Catholic believers say that the <span>Virgin Mary</span> appeared nearby a <span>waterfall</span>. Due to this belief, a sculpture of the virgin, called <i id=\"mwIw\">Virgen de Agua Santa</i>, was placed in the city's <span>cathedral</span>. </p>\n\n","Phnom Penh":"<p id=\"mwA-k\">Phnom Penh also has its own dialect of <span>Khmer</span>. Speakers of the Phnom Penh dialect often <span>elide</span> syllables, which has earned it the reputation for being lazy speech.

At the intersection of the Baltic Sea and lake <span>Mälaren</span> is an archipelago site where the <span>Old Town</span> of Stockholm was first built from about 1000 CE by Vikings.

The Puruhas presented a fierce resistance to the Inca intentions of conquering the north of today's Ecuador, and therefore obliged the Inca Huayna Capac to find an alliance in order to pacify the tribes who sided with Condorazo, the general of the Puruha nation. This alliance sealed the peace between the Shyris confederation, named by the Jesuit historian Juan de Velasco to the group of tribes whose ruler were the Duchicela dynasty, and the Inca Empire. The Inca Huayna Capac took as his wife the princess Paccha and gave special treatment and social status privileges to the higher castes of the new subjects. The offspring of this dynastic relation was Atahualpa, the last king of the Incas.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Ruhnu":"<p><span class=\"flagicon\"><figure-inline class=\"mw-image-border\"

The subject of this article is a settlement that was created by <span>Sobhuza II</span> in the northwest section of the country.</p>\n\n","Vormsi":"<p id=\"mwGg\">Vormsi's history as an inhabited island dates back as far as the 13th century.  During most of its history, the island has been inhabited by <span>Estonian Swedes</span> (\"rannarootslased\" in <span>Estonian</span> or \"coastal Swedes\" in <span>English</span>), whose population reached 3,000 before <span>World War II</span>. During the war, nearly all of Vormsi's population, along with other Swedes living in Estonia, forming the larger region of <span>Aiboland</span>, were evacuated, or fled, to Sweden. The island's current registered population is approximately 400 inhabitants.</p>\n<p id=\"mwMg\">Vormsi is the per capita wealthiest island and region in <span>Estonia</span> outside of the <span>Tallinn</span> metro area, with incomes on the same level as inner <span>Tallinn</span> in <span>Estonia</span>. This is attributed to the fact that many comparatively wealthy people own summer homes on the island and are registered as residents, so their yearly income tax is forwarded to the island's budget.</p>\n\n","Poperinge":"<p id=\"mwgA\">Archaeological finds in the area date local habitation back to the <span>Neolithic</span>. Under the Romans a link was made to it from the road between <span>Cassel</span> and <span>Aardenburg</span>. In the time of the <span>Franks</span> it appeared under the name <i id=\"mwhQ\">Pupurningahem</i> and was made subject to the ecclesiastical benefice of <span>Saint Omer</span> in the mid-7th century. The Count of Flanders, <span>Dietrich of Alsace</span>, granted the town a charter in 1147 at the request of the abbot. From this time it began to thrive as a cloth-making centre and, in order to accommodate the growing population, the churches of Saint John and of Our Lady were added in 1290 to the already existing Sint-Bertinuskerk.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Muhu":"<p id=\"mwHw\">The most important villages in Muhu are <span>Kuivastu</span>, <span>Liiva</span> (where the school can be found) and <span>Koguva</span>. In <span>Pädaste</span>, an internationally renowned luxury hotel and spa operates in the restored manor house.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Otepää":"<p id=\"mwFg\">The first settlement in Otepää was in 6th century BC.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Rakvere":"<p id=\"mwEw\">The earliest signs of human settlement dating back to the 3rd–5th centuries <span>AD</span> have been found on the present theatre hill. Probably to protect that settlement, a wooden stronghold was built on the present Vallimägi. When it changed owners in 1220, the <span>Danes</span> started to erect buildings from stone. A settlement called <i id=\"mwFg\">Tarvanpea</i> was first mentioned in the <span>Chronicle of Henry of Livonia</span> in 1226. The new <span>Danish</span> stronghold was called <i id=\"mwGQ\">Wesenbergh</i> in <span>Middle Low German</span> for the first time in 1252. The <span>battle of Wesenberg</span> between the Danish and <span>German</span> knights  and <span>Russians</span> occurred nearby on 18 February 1268.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Haapsalu":"<p id=\"mwSg\">Haapsalu is site of a fencing school founded by Estonian fencer Endel Nelis, used as the setting of the Finnish-Estonian film <i id=\"mwSw\"><span>The Fencer</span></i>.</p>\n<p id=\"mwOg\">The Land of <span>Ilon Wikland</span> (<i id=\"mwPA\"><span>Wiklandia</span></i>), a recreation centre for children, is set to open in a few years within the town. This world-famous book illustrator has been involved with Haapsalu since her childhood.</p>\n\n\n\n","Samsø":"<p id=\"mwnw\">Agriculture has been the primary occupation on Samsø for millennia and nearly all of the island comprise cultured landscapes. Nowadays, farming is still an important business and the biggest contributor to the islands economy, but compared to the rest of Denmark, it has developed in its own direction. <span>Free range</span> farming is very prominent, and the agricultural produce comprise mostly potatoes, various other vegetables and berries as well as some animal husbandry. In the 2000s, especially the vegetable and berry production has increased, as the Samsø brand has become more widely known and popular. At the same time, packaging and industrial processing is increasingly taken care of on the island before shipping, again increasing the local revenue of the farming trade overall. Close to 16% of the islanders work in the fishing and farming sector, not including derived labour, compared to 3.5% countrywide.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mwJQ\">Ballen's beach and village are popular with visitors. The island is served by a bus service which runs around the island, including the two ferry terminals in Sælvig and Ballen. In clear weather, the peninsula of <span>Helgenæs</span> to the north is visible.\nGeographically, the island divides into three areas:</p>\n<ul id=\"mwJw\"><li id=\"mwKA\">the North Island</li>\n<li id=\"mwKQ\">the Stavns Fjord</li>\n<li id=\"mwKg\">the South Island</li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n","Bata":"<p id=\"mwGA\">After the anti-Spanish riots of 1969, the European population declined in Bata, and severe economic stagnation affected Bata in the 1970s and early 1980s.\nThe recent oil boom of the country in the late 1980s and 1990s has boosted the development of the city.</p>\n<p id=\"mwHg\">Bata has one of the deepest seaports in the region. Despite this, Bata has no natural harbor and a jetty was built to facilitate offshore handling of ships' cargoes. The principal exports are <span>timber</span> and <span>coffee</span>.</p>","Kampot":"<p id=\"mwJA\">Under 19th century <span>French colonial administration</span> Kampot became a regional administrative centre with the status of a state border district as a result of the <span>delimitation of the Kingdom of Cambodia</span>. The <i id=\"mwJw\">Circonscription Résidentielle de Kampot</i> contained the <span>arrondissements</span> of Kampot, Kompong-Som, Trang, and Kong-Pisey.</p>\n\n","Manzini":"<p id=\"mwJg\">Residential areas radiate outward from the Central Business District.  At the western terminous of the city on the highway to Mbabane is KaKhoza Township, a poor neighborhood with the appearance of an informal settlement.  North of downtown beyond the Mavuso International Trade Fair (opened 2004) along a bypass road (opened 1994, rebuilt 2004 for the opening of the Mavuso Trade Fair) is Helemesi Estates.  Here middle-class dwellings were erected in the early 1990s on the former farm of Sydney Williams, the long-serving Resident Commissioner during British rule.  Helemesi is the SiSwati corruption of the name Williams.  The housing development is surrounded by Fairview Township, developed in 1964 during the twilight of colonial rule as Eswatini's first integrated residential neighbourhood.  19th century law, reaffirmed by ordinances in the 1920s, forbade Swazis from residing or owning businesses in Bremserdorp.  Until the 1960s Swazi business proprietors used Europeans as fronts in order to operate \"Native Eating Houses\" and other establishments.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mwEQ\">A commercial centre from the time a trading post was opened in 1885, Bremersdorp was designated a township in 1898.  Arthur Bremer sold his hotel for use as British Colonial authorities who had administered Swaziland since 1894 as their national administrative headquarters, and stipulated that the settlement would bear his name (<i id=\"mwEg\">dorp</i> is the <span>Afrikaans</span> word for \"small town\"). The name reverted to its original Swazi name, Manzini, in 1960.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","W National Park":"<p id=\"mwMQ\">In the three nations, the Regional park covers some <span about=\"#mwt43\" typeof=\"mw:Transclusion\" data-mw=\"{&quot;parts&quot;:[{&quot;template&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;cvt&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;./Template:Cvt&quot;},&quot;params&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;10000&quot;},&quot;2&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;km²&quot;}},&quot;i&quot;:0}}]}\" id=\"mwMg\">10,000</span><span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" about=\"#mwt43\">&nbsp;</span><span about=\"#mwt43\">km</span><span about=\"#mwt43\"> (3,900</span><span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" about=\"#mwt43\">&nbsp;</span><span about=\"#mwt43\">sq</span><span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" about=\"#mwt43\">&nbsp;</span><span about=\"#mwt43\">mi)</span> largely uninhabited by humans, having been until the 1970s a <span>Malarial</span> zone of wetlands formed by the delta of the <span>Mekrou River</span> with the Niger, broken by rocky hills. Historically, the area has been at one time a major area of human habitation, judged by the important archaeological sites (mostly tombs) found in the area.</p>\n<p id=\"mwIQ\">The W National Park of Niger was created by <span>decree</span> on 4 August 1954, and since 1996 has been listed as a <span>UNESCO</span> <span>World Heritage Site</span>. Within Niger, the Park is listed as a <span>National Park</span>, <span>IUCN</span> Type II, and is part of a larger complex of Reserves and protected areas. These include the adjacent Dallol Bosso (Wetlands of International Importance (Ramsar) on the eastern bank of the <span>Niger River</span> and the partial overlap of the smaller \"Parc national du W\" (Wetlands of International Importance (Ramsar). The three parks are <span>BirdLife International</span> <span>Important Bird Areas</span> (IBAs) of types A1 and A3 (IBA codes IBA NE001, IBA BF008, and IBA BJ001).</p>","Noel Kempff Mercado National Park":"<p id=\"mwHA\">In 1908, <span>Percy Fawcett</span> first explored the area that is now the national park. It was not until almost 70 years later that the area was looked at again. In the 1970s geologists were sent to the area to survey the rock formations of the Precambrian Shield region in Bolivia. They published on the geology and landforms and produced the first maps. This expedition attracted the attention of conservation biologist <span>Noel Kempff Mercado</span>. Mercado recognized the global significance of the area enough to propose a campaign to preserve it. Mercado was murdered by drug traffickers in 1986, before the campaign achieved its aims. The government declared a 750,000 hectare area of undisturbed land as a national park in 1988, and named it in his honour.</p>","Otavalo":"<p id=\"mwRg\">Many people come to Otavalo to visit the market, but the city and surrounding area is also home to the Peguche Waterfall, Lagos de Mojanda, and Museo Viviente Otavalango. The museum is located in the \"antigua fabrica San Pedro,\" where indigenous Otavaleños worked in sweatshop style labor for generations under brutal conditions. After the factory was shut down, a group of locals purchased the land and have since reclaimed the factory and its grounds as a living museum and community space for the indigenous community. The museum shows aspects of Otavaleño life both historically and in present day, and allows visitors to interact with the indigenous craftspeople making textiles and farming. The museum also serves as a community space, with concerts, weddings, and community meetings held in buildings on the grounds.  In addition, a short taxi ride or hike from town you will find Parque Condor, a bird rescue centre and educational facility.  Aiming to educate locals and tourists about the conservation of wild birds, they offer a daily flight display to view some of the birds in flight.</p>","Salar de Uyuni":"<p id=\"mwNQ\">Salar de Uyuni is part of the <span>Altiplano</span> of Bolivia in South America. The Altiplano is a high plateau, which was formed during uplift of the Andes mountains. The plateau includes fresh and saltwater lakes as well as salt flats and is surrounded by mountains with no drainage outlets.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mw4A\">The Salar is virtually devoid of any wildlife or vegetation. The latter is dominated by giant cacti (<i id=\"mw4Q\"><span>Echinopsis</span> atacamensis pasacana</i>, <i id=\"mw4w\">Echinopsis tarijensis</i>, etc.). They grow at a rate of about 1<span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" id=\"mw5A\">&nbsp;</span>cm/a to a height of about 12<span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" id=\"mw5Q\">&nbsp;</span>m. Other shrubs include Pilaya, which is used by locals to cure <span>catarrh</span>, and Thola (<i id=\"mw5w\"><span>Baccharis</span> dracunculifolia</i>), which is burned as a fuel. Also present are <span>quinoa</span> plants and <span>queñua</span> bushes.</p>\n\n","Heredia":"<p id=\"mwFQ\">Prior to its founding, the area around Heredia was inhabited by the native tribe that is known as the <span>Huetares</span>, who were commanded at the coming of the Spanish by the <i id=\"mwFw\"><span>Cacique</span></i> <span>Garavito</span>. In 1706 settlers from <span>Cartago</span>, set up a small church at a place they called \"Alvirilla\", which soon became more populated. Between 1716 and 1717 the settlers moved their village to the north, to a place the Indians called <b id=\"mwHQ\">Cubujuquí</b>. In 1736 Heredia was deemed sufficiently large to be granted its own parish, and the first incarnation of the Iglesia de la Inmaculada was built to serve as its parish church.

The absence of the <span>mongoose</span>, a major predator, has also played a part in the survival on Taveuni of land crabs, the unique Fiji fruit bat, the Taveuni silk bat, and some unique species of <span>palm</span>.

Originally established in what is now the archaeological site of <span>Ciudad Vieja</span>, north of the present-day city, it was moved to the <i id=\"mwTA\">Valle de Las Hamacas</i>, so named for the intense seismic activity that characterizes it. The new site was chosen because it had more space and more fertile land, thanks to the Acelhuate River.

Depending on the year, 20%-40% of visitors are foreign.  Mr. Farouk Umaru Dubiure, the Park Manager, says “Though we received many visitors, the funds generated were very low because 70 percent of the visitors were Ghanaian students who pay little to visit the park. These students also visit the Park on the same day and return, compared to the foreigners who spend more days to view the Park well” </p>\n<p id=\"mwGg\">The park's lands were set aside as a wildlife refuge in 1958. In 1971 the small human population of the area was relocated and the lands were designated a national park. The park has not seen major development as a tourist location since its original designation. The park as a protective area is underfunded and national and international concerns exist about poaching and sustainability in the park, but its protection of important resident antelope species has improved since its initial founding as a preserve.</p>\n\n\n\n","Nadi":"<p id=\"mwKA\">Nadi Township was established in 1947.

Today it is a regional centre for culture and entertainment with an important <span>opera house</span>, historical and maritime museums, five art galleries and numerous cinemas, clubs, bars and restaurants.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mwA7s\">Marseille is listed as a major centre of art and history. The city has many museums and galleries and there are many ancient buildings and churches of historical interest.</p>\n\n","Düsseldorf":"<p id=\"mwAro\">Elector <span>Jan Wellem</span> and his wife <span>Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici</span> of Tuscany, were patrons of Düsseldorf's first significant cultural activities in the 17th and 18th centuries. <span>Heinrich Heine</span>, whose 200th birthday was celebrated in 1997 and who originally had a proposed <span>memorial</span> in the city dedicated to him; Clara and <span>Robert Schumann</span>; and as <span>Felix Mendelssohn</span>, are the most prominent artists related to the city, which is home to a distinguished <span>Academy of Fine Arts</span>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mwAhg\">Düsseldorf has become one of the top <span>telecommunications</span> centres in Germany. With two of the four big German providers of mobile frequencies, <span>D2 Vodafone</span> and <span>E-Plus</span>, Düsseldorf leads the German <span>mobile phone</span> market.

Food processing predominated during the <span>Industrial Age</span>, with sugar refineries (Beghin-Say), biscuit factories (<span>LU</span> and <span>BN Biscuit</span>), canned fish (Saupiquet and Tipiak) and processed vegetables (Bonduelle and Cassegrain); these brands still dominate the French market. The Nantes region is France's largest food producer; the city has recently become a hub of innovation in food security, with laboratories and firms such as <span>Eurofins Scientific</span>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Nature Park Bulgarka":"<p id=\"mwOQ\">Forests cover about 80.2% of the park area, or 17,461 hectares. Varieties of <span>beech</span> constitute the largest portion of the forest, at 65%. Other deciduous trees include oaks, water locust, birch hornbeam, linden, elm, acacia, aspen, maple, ash, wild cherry, holly, rowan, birch and others. Coniferous trees found in the park include white and black pine, spruce, fir, white fir and others. <span>Gymnosperm</span> plants covers about 0.6 ha.</p>\n\n \n\n \n\n","Koli National Park":"<p id=\"mwHQ\">The most well-known vantage point in the park is Ukko-Koli, with a grand view to the East over lake <span>Pielinen</span>. Near the top there is the Heritage Center Ukko and Hotel Koli. Two long scenery lifts operate during the summer.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Koforidua":"<p id=\"mwhA\">Koforidua's predominant tourism attractions include such natural features as Obuo Tabri Mountain, which is considered sacred.

The municipality covers an estimated area of 110 square kilometres, constituting 0.57% of the total land area of the Eastern Region. The municipality has 48 electoral areas.</p>\n\n\n\n","Tamale":"<p id=\"mwOA\">Tamale is located on the crossing of three ancient trade routes; it started to grow as a commercial centre for the Northern region centuries ago. The north-south road from <span>Paga</span> and <span>Bolgatanga</span> to <span>Salaga</span> had raiders passing, whilst other merchants brought their goods into Tamale. Salt came from <span>Daboya</span>, to the north-west of Tamale, and followed a road that continued to <span>Yendi.</span> A third road linked <span>Gushegu</span> to the capital of the <span>Gonja kingdom</span>, <span>Damongo</span>. The present locations of the central market and the palace of the Gulkpe naa, opposite <span>Barclays Bank</span> and near the library, mark the junctions of the ancient roads.</p>\n\n\n\n\n","Sunyani":"<p id=\"mwFQ\">Sunyani is surrounded by the forested Southern <span>Ashanti</span> uplands. The city of Sunyani rose as an outpost camp for elephant hunters during the 19th century; its name derives from the <span>Akan</span> word for elephant, 'Osono'. In 1924, the <span>colonial</span> government designated Sunyani as a district headquarters. Following the construction of a road connecting Sunyani and the city of <span>Kumasi</span>, Sunyani became an important hub for the distribution of <span>cocoa</span>, <span>kola nuts</span>, and staple foods such as maize and <span>yams</span>. Today Sunyani is home to the Brong-Ahafo regional government and high court. Although considerably smaller than <span>Kumasi</span>, Sunyani is growing rapidly and has effectively engulfed the suburbs of <span>Fiapre</span> and <span>Abesim</span>, amongst others. Sunyani is a clean and well maintained city with a thriving economy.</p>\n<p id=\"mwKQ\">The economy of Sunyani is predominantly agrarian with approximately 48% of the population engaged in agriculture production. About 24 percent of the population is employed in the <span>service</span> sector, followed by commerce and industry which employ 15% and 13% of the populace, respectively.\nMany women and unskilled people are engaged in commerce notably in the <a rel=\"mw:ExtLink\" href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/nLvBGB3gW952\" class=\"external autonumber\" id=\"mwLQ\"></a> Wednesday Market]]. The city's growth is boosted by Sunyani's high-quality water supply. Sunyani is provided with electricity by the <span>Volta River Authority</span> (VRA). Water sources include rain water and water from streams, rivers and springs. However, in severe harmattan (dry) conditions, water can become more difficult to access.</p>\n\n","Kakadu National Park":"<p id=\"mwAok\">The Kakadu National Park is proclaimed under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (the EPBC Act) and is managed through a joint management arrangement between the Aboriginal traditional owners and the Director of National Parks. The Director manages Commonwealth national parks through Parks Australia, which is a part of the Department of the Environment and Energy. Title to Aboriginal land in the park is held by Aboriginal land trusts. The land trusts have leased their land to the Director of National Parks for the purpose of a national park for the enjoyment and benefit of all Australians and international visitors. Traditional owners have also expected that having their land managed as a national park would assist them in looking after their land in the face of growing and competing pressures. They saw a national park as establishing a way to manage the land that could protect their interests and be sympathetic to their aspirations. Parks Australia and the Aboriginal traditional owners of Kakadu are committed to the principle of joint management of the park and arrangements to help this happen are highlighted in Kakadu's Plan of Management.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mwARI\">Kakadu's flora is among the richest in <span>northern Australia</span> with more than 1700 plant species\nrecorded which is a result of the park's geological, landform and habitat diversity. Kakadu is also considered to be one of the most weed free national parks in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Kumasi":"<p id=\"mwfQ\">Features of the city include Fort Kumasi (built by in 1896 to replace an Asante fort and now a museum) and the Kumasi Hat Museum.</p>\n\n\n<p id=\"mwng\">The main occupations in Kumasi are professional such as <span>services</span> and manufacturing.</p>\n\n","Libreville":"<p id=\"mwQA\">From north to south, major districts of the city are the <span>residential</span> area <span>Batterie IV</span>, <span>Quartier Louis</span> (known for its <span>nightlife</span>), <span>Mont-Bouët</span> and <span>Nombakélé</span> (busy commercial areas), <span>Glass</span> (the first European settlement in Gabon), <span>Oloumi</span> (a major industrial area) and <span>Lalala</span>, a residential area. The city's port and train station on the <span>Trans-Gabon Railway</span> line to <span>Franceville</span> lie in <span>Owendo</span>, south of the main built-up area. Inland from these districts lie poorer residential areas. North-west of Equatorial Guinea is where the city stands, labeling the city as a part of north-west Gabon. In terms of the country's surrounding boundaries, north is <span>Cameroon</span>, east is <span>Congo</span>, and south-east is the <span>Democratic Republic of the Congo</span>. It also rides the shores of the South Atlantic Ocean, which is on the country's west coast for reference. Additionally, in terms of aquatic geography, the Komo River passes through the city and empties into the ocean. The <span>Komo River</span> also stands as a potential hydroelectric source of power for the city which could generate supportive amounts of energy and power. Several city districts provide distinct and separate benefits throughout the city as well. In terms of nightlife, the Quartier Louis sector is most renowned. One of this zone's sides includes the coast, and this heavily influences the possible activities available in the area. Commercial areas within Libreville are housed in the Mont-Bouët and Nombakélé districts, which feature several shopping centers and stations selling purchasable goods. Oloumi contains much of the city's industry, integrating production separately from the districts that focus upon other aspects. Finally, Lalala and Batterie IV are residential and housing sectors, where much of the populace resides.</p>\n<p id=\"mwGw\">The area was inhabited by the <span>Mpongwé</span> tribe long before the

According to mythology, the maiden Parvati resolves to marry the loner ascetic <span>Shiva</span>. Her parents learn of her desire and discourage her, but she pursues her desire. Shiva is lost in yogic meditation, oblivious to the world; Parvati appeals to the gods for help to awaken him and gain his attention. Indra sends the god <span>Kama</span>—the Hindu god of desire, erotic love, attraction, and affection—to awake Shiva from meditation. Kama reaches Shiva and shoots an arrow of desire. Shiva opens his third eye in his forehead and burns Kama to ashes. Parvati does not lose her hope or her resolve to win over Shiva; she begins to live like him and engage in the same activities—asceticism, <span>yogin</span> and <span>tapasya</span>—awakening him and attracting his interest. Shiva meets Parvati in disguised form and tries to discourage her, telling her Shiva's weaknesses and personality problems. Parvati refuses to listen and insists in her resolve. Shiva finally accepts her and they get married. According to <i id=\"mwdQ\"><span>Sthala Purana</span></i>, Parvati (Pampa) pursued her ascetic, yogini lifestyle on Hemakuta Hill, now a part of Hampi, to win and bring ascetic Shiva back into householder life.

In the <span>First Book of the Maccabees</span>, it is referred to as the place that Shimon HaHashmonai was responsible for in 144BCE (<span>1 Maccabees</span> 11:59). <span>Josephus</span> Flavius also describes Rosh Hanikra as the northern border of the city of <span>Acre, Israel</span>.

This is the westernmost part of Ireland, and the village of <i id=\"mwRg\"><span>Dún Chaoin</span></i> is often jokingly referred to as \"the next parish to America.\"</p>\n<p id=\"mwLg\">The peninsula exists because of the band of <span>sandstone</span> rock that forms the <span>Slieve Mish</span> mountain range at the neck of the peninsula, in the east, and the <span>Brandon Group</span> of mountains, and the <span>Mountains of the Central Dingle Peninsula</span> further to the west. Ireland's highest mountain outside <span>MacGillycuddy's Reeks</span>, <span>Mount Brandon</span> at 951<span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" id=\"mwNQ\">&nbsp;</span>m, forms part of a high ridge with views over the peninsula and North Kerry.</p>\n\n\n\n","Ajlun":"<p id=\"mwOQ\">There is a theory that the town's name is connected with the <span>Moabite</span> King <span>Eglon</span> mentioned in the Bible, though the precise derivation is obscure.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Glendalough":"<p id=\"mwGQ\">Kevin, a descendant of one of the ruling families in <span>Leinster</span>, studied as a boy under the care of three holy men, <span>Eoghan</span>, Lochan, and Eanna.  During this time, he went to Glendalough.  He was to return later, with a small group of <span>monks</span> to found a monastery where the 'two rivers form a confluence'. Kevin's writings discuss his fighting \"knights\" at Glendalough; scholars today believe this refers to his process of self-examination and his personal temptations.  His fame as a holy man spread and he attracted numerous followers. He died in about <span>618</span>, traditionally on 3 June.  For the next six centuries, Glendalough flourished and the <span>Irish Annals</span> contain references to the deaths of <span>abbots</span> and raids on the settlement.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n","Lake Garda":"<p id=\"mwKQ\">The northern part of the lake is narrower, surrounded by mountains, the majority of which belong to the <span>Gruppo del Baldo</span>. The shape is typical of a <span>moraine</span> valley, probably having been formed under the action of a <span>Paleolithic</span> glacier. Although traces of the glacier's actions are evident today, in more recent years it has been hypothesised that the glacier occupied a previously existing depression, created by stream erosion 5 to 6 million years ago.</p>\n\n\n\n","Yazd":"<p id=\"mwMw\">The name is derived from <span>Yazdegerd I</span>, a <span>Sassanid</span> ruler of <span>Persia</span>.

There is also a considerable ceramics and construction materials industry and unique confectionery and jewellery industries. A significant portion of the population is also employed in other industries including agriculture, dairy, metal works, and machine manufacturing.

After <span>World War II</span>, Gjakova has built an economy based on industry and agriculture but also in the service sector. Nowadays, these subsequent shifts in transitional societies are escorted with shifts in the economic structure of the city. Therefore, Gjakova has an economic structure that is based on two pillars: in the private business sector and social business sector which is currently being privatized. Private business sector is in expansion and the main indicators qualify it as the main component of Gjakova's economy.</p>\n\n\n\n","Madaba":"<p id=\"mwmw\">Madaba's main attraction is its Byzantine mosaics, drawing many visitors, especially since the creation of an archaeological park.

In 1990, Mohammed Faheli, an Arab resident of Acre, founded the Acre Jewish-Arab association, which originally operated out of two bomb shelters. In 1993, Dame <span>Vivien Duffield</span> of the Clore Foundation donated funds for a new building. Among the programs offered is Peace Child Israel, which employs theatre and the arts to teach coexistence. The participants, Jews and Arabs, spend two months studying conflict resolution and then work together to produce an original theatrical performance that addresses the issues they have explored. Another program is Patriots of Acre, a community responsibility and youth tourism program that teaches children to become ambassadors for their city. In the summer, the centre runs an Arab-Jewish summer camp for 120 disadvantaged children aged 5–11. Some 1,000 children take part in the Acre Centre's youth club and youth programming every week. Adult education programs have been developed for Arab women interested in completing their high school education and acquiring computer skills to prepare for joining the workforce. The centre also offers parenting courses, and music and dance classes.</p>\n\n\n<p id=\"mwArM\">Acre's Old City has been designated by <span>UNESCO</span> as a <span>World Heritage Site</span>.

In 2009, renovations were planned for Khan al-Umdan, the \"Inn of the Columns,\" the largest of several Ottoman inns still standing in Acre. It was built near the port at the end of the 18th century by <span>Jazzar Pasha</span>. Merchants who arrived at the port would unload their wares on the first floor and sleep in lodgings on the second floor.

The <span>Kidron Valley</span> runs to the east of the Old City and separates the <span>Mount of Olives</span> from the city proper. Along the southern side of old Jerusalem is the <span>Valley of Hinnom</span>, a steep ravine associated in biblical <span>eschatology</span> with the concept of <span>Gehenna</span> or <span>Hell</span>. The <span>Tyropoeon Valley</span> commenced in the northwest near the <span>Damascus Gate</span>, ran south-southeasterly through the center of the Old City down to the <span>Pool of Siloam</span>, and divided the lower part into two hills, the Temple Mount to the east, and the rest of the city to the west (the lower and the upper cities described by <span>Josephus</span>). Today, this valley is hidden by debris that has accumulated over the centuries.\nIn biblical times, Jerusalem was surrounded by forests of almond, olive and pine trees. Over centuries of warfare and neglect, these forests were destroyed. Farmers in the Jerusalem region thus built stone terraces along the slopes to hold back the soil, a feature still very much in evidence in the Jerusalem landscape.<link rel=\"mw:PageProp/Category\" href=\"./Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements\" about=\"#mwt1901\" typeof=\"mw:Transclusion\" data-mw=\"{&quot;parts&quot;:[{&quot;template&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;Citation needed&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;./Template:Citation_needed&quot;},&quot;params&quot;:{&quot;date&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;October 2010&quot;}},&quot;i&quot;:0}}]}\" id=\"mwBek\"><link rel=\"mw:PageProp/Category\" href=\"./Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_October_2010\" about=\"#mwt1901\"></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Ungheni":"<p id=\"mwGA\">The first historical mention of Ungheni dates to 20 August 1462.

The Amorites at first did not practice agriculture like more advanced Mesopotamians, preferring a semi-nomadic lifestyle, herding sheep. Over time, Amorite grain merchants rose to prominence and established their own independent dynasties in several south Mesopotamian city-states, most notably <span>Isin</span>, <span>Larsa</span>, <span>Eshnunna</span>, <span>Lagash</span>, and later, founding Babylon as a state.</p>\n\n","Yogyakarta":"<p id=\"mw_A\">Yogyakarta is home to a myriad of heritage buildings, landmarks and important monuments.

The region controlled from Hatra was the <span>Kingdom of Araba</span>, a semi-autonomous buffer kingdom on the western limits of the Parthian Empire, governed by Arabian princes.</p>\n\n\n\n\n","Zahle":"<p id=\"mwARY\">Zahlé's culture has long revolved around its signature crop, the grape, and its products, wine and arak. Arak, in particular, has traditionally been served in <span>cafés</span> at virtually any time of the day. The city is known as \"the City of Wine and Poetry\". A graceful personification of this nickname stands at the town's entrance: a statue of <span>Erato</span>, the <span>Muse</span> of <span>love poetry</span>, holding a bunch of grapes.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mwKg\">There has been human activity in the area for at least 5000 years. In the 18th century, Zahlé was a small village of some 200 houses. Its relative geographic isolation from the local centres of power in Mount Lebanon and Syria caused the village not to have any significant allies in the region to fall back on in case of conflicts or attacks.

In the west, the <span>Rhine</span> forms the natural border with <span>Switzerland</span>, and in the east, the town is dominated by the Three Sisters mountain range. Schaan also has four exclaves within other municipalities, and two enclaves within its municipality.</p>\n<p id=\"mwGw\">Recent archaeological finds have shown that Schaan has been inhabited for over 6000 years: In the year 15 BC, The Romans conquered, under Augustus, the territory of the present Principality of Liechtenstein and built the Roman province of Raetia. In the 1st century AD, a Military Highway from Milan-Bregenz was created, which ran along the Luzisteig along the right bank of the Rhine, leading to the building of settlements in modern-day Schaan. Also from the 1st century AD are two Roman legionnaire's helmets, which were found in 1887 during digging work above Dux and probably as dedications of the two Roman legionaries <i id=\"mwHA\">Publius Cavidius Felix</i> and <i id=\"mwHQ\">Numerius Pomponius</i>, whose names are engraved on the helmets, buried here. They are now housed in the museums of Bregenz and Zurich. The most important Roman building on the municipal land is a fort built in the valley, which was built to protect against the ever more frequent Alemannic invasions. Remains of its foundations and the gate tower are again visible from St. Peter's Church, Schaan. A baptistery from the 5th century, which was found during excavations inside this church, suggests an early Christianization. During excavations, there were also older traces of settlement from prehistoric times.</p>\n\n","Djenné":"<p id=\"mwAXQ\">The main attractions are the Great Mosque and the two-story adobe houses with their monumental façades.

The British controlled the city for several brief periods. The British <span>East India Company</span> (EIC) started trading with the city, which they called Tamborneo or Tomborneo, in 1614. In 1703 the EIC established a factory there, which the inhabitants destroyed four years later. The EIC attempted, highly unsuccessfully, to trade with the city between 1736 and 1746, and then in 1747 the Sultan signed a treaty with the Dutch giving them a trade monopoly.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mwEQ\">Main economic sectors include transportation and communication (26.1% of the city's GDP), processing industries (24.9%) and trade and commerce (16.5%).

Another nickname that has been given to the city is \"the red\" (<i id=\"mwApA\">la rossa</i>), which was originally \nused as a reference to the colour of the buildings in the city centre, has later become connected with the communist ideology supported by the majority of the population, in particular after World War II: until the election of a centre-right mayor in 1999, the city was renowned as a bastion of the <span>Italian Communist Party</span>. The centre-left regained power again in the 2004 mayoral elections, with the election of <span>Sergio Cofferati</span>. It was one of the first European cities to experiment with the concept of <span>free public transport</span>.\nBologna has also two other nicknames: the first one, \"the towered\" (<i id=\"mwApg\">la turrita</i>) refers to the high number of medieval towers that can be found in the city, even if today only 24 towers are still standing. The second one, \"the learned\" (<i id=\"mwApk\">la dotta</i>) is a reference to its university.</p>\n\n\n<p id=\"mwAgE\">In terms of total GDP, the <span>Metropolitan City of Bologna</span> generated a value of about €35 billion ($40.6 billion) in 2017, equivalent to €34,251 ($40,165) per capita, the third highest figure among Italian provinces (after <span>Milan</span> and <span>Bolzano/Bozen</span>).</p>\n\n\n\n","Galway":"<p id=\"mwAeY\">Galway is known as <i id=\"mwAec\">Ireland's Cultural Heart</i> (<i id=\"mwAeg\">Croí Cultúrtha na hÉireann</i>) and is renowned for its vibrant lifestyle and numerous festivals, celebrations and events.

A settlement grew around it. During the <span>Norman</span> invasion of Connacht in the 1230s, Dún Gaillimhe was captured by <span>Richard Mor de Burgh</span>, who had led the invasion. As the de<span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" id=\"mwWA\">&nbsp;</span>Burghs eventually became <span>Gaelicised</span>, the merchants of the town, the <span>Tribes of Galway</span>, pushed for greater control over the <span>walled city</span>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Osaka":"<p id=\"mwAqI\">The gross city product of Osaka in fiscal year 2004 was ¥21.3 trillion, an increase of 1.2% over the previous year.

It was removed from the atomic bomb target list (which it had headed) by the personal intervention of Secretary of War <span>Henry L. Stimson</span>, as Stimson wanted to save this cultural center, which he knew from his honeymoon and later diplomatic visits. Kyoto has been, and still remains, Japan's cultural center. The government of Japan is relocating the <span>Agency for Cultural Affairs</span> to Kyoto in 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mwA2o\">Kyoto contains roughly 2,000 temples and shrines.</p>\n\n","Nur-Sultan":"<p id=\"mw_A\">Nur-Sultan is almost 1000 km away from the country's largest city and former capital, <span>Almaty</span>.

Principal exports from the port include <span>sugar</span>, <span>tobacco</span>, and <span>coffee</span>. Its rich history as a trading port has led to a strong financial infrastructure with modern economic institutions such as banks, insurance, and sound export-import companies. The economy is influenced by the recent growth in foreign industries and the completion of the <span>Suramadu Bridge</span>. The high potential and economic activities make the city an attractive destination to foreign investors.\nThe city is home to a large <span>shipyard</span> and numerous specialized naval schools. The <span>Bank of Indonesia</span> has also made plans for Surabaya to be the Islamic financial center of Indonesia.</p>\n\n","Haifa":"<p id=\"mwA_Q\">Despite its image as a port and industrial city, Haifa is the cultural hub of northern Israel.

Genoa was a powerful port and briefly entered in conflict with Venice over the Mediterranean Trade. Genoa always struggled to rule itself, with many inner conflicts among the nobility weakening the Republic. This inability to rule itself caused Genoa to put themselves twice under French rule, once in 1391 then in 1458. The Black Death in 1348 hit Genoa hard and contributed to its decline. Genoa also owned the island of Corsica but sold it to France in 1768 due to financial struggles. It was 1796 that the Republic of Genoa finally ended, replaced by French ruled Ligurian Republic. Since 1815 after the \"Congresso di Vienna\" Genoa joined the Regno di Sardegna (Sardinia Kingdom). Italian unification of 1861 resulted in Genoa becoming the maritime hub of the new Italian state. Genoese establishment of trade routes along the Mediterranean brought wealth and political power to the city. The fleet’s participation in the Crusades allowed Genoa to further establish prosperous trading colonies in the Holy Land. The Genoese trading station of <span>Caffa</span> in <span>Crimea</span> brought the <span>Black Death</span> to Europe, through infected rats on ships fleeing siege in 1346.</p>","Amman":"<p id=\"mwAc8\">Amman is situated on the <span>East Bank Plateau</span>, an upland characterized by three major <span>wadis</span> which run through it.

The post never became self-sufficient, and habitually required assistance from the station at <span>Elmina</span>, about 750 miles away by sea.\n<span>Théodore Canot</span>, a writer and slave-trader, established a settlement in the area in 1840.\nIn 1849 the Liberian government signed a treaty with the <span>Vai people</span>, acquiring the territory of Cape Mount and subsequently founding Robertsport in 1856.</p>\n\n\n\n","Kratovo":"<p id=\"mwig\">Kratovo is known for its many reminders from the past. One of its symbols are its stone towers. Once there were twelve of them, but now there are only six towers remaining (Saat or Clock Tower, Simić, Krstev, Eminbeg, Zlatković and Hadži Kostov Tower). The towers were built in <span>late Middle Ages</span>, starting from late 14th century and were used not only for protection but also as storage rooms.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n","Cape Maclear":"<p id=\"mwTw\">Cape Maclear is \"a leading tourist destination\", and is the busiest resort on Lake Malawi. The area is popular with <span>backpackers</span>. There are bars, restaurants, lodges and guesthouses in the town. Activities available in Cape Maclear include <span>snorkelling</span>, hiking, boat cruises, <span>kayaking</span>, and diving.  In October 2001, the Malawian government invited investors to fund a $6,000,000 construction of a new 150-room, four-star hotel at Cape Maclear. In June 2003, plans were announced to build an ecolodge on Maleri Island, near Cape Maclear. In February 2005, the Malawian government announced plans to increase <span>ecotourism</span> at Cape Maclear with new accommodation and facilities. These plans proved too ambitious for the fragile Malawian economy and tourist industry.</p>\n<p id=\"mwIQ\">In 1859, the <span>missionary</span> and <span>explorer</span> <span>David Livingstone</span> found the Cape, and named it \"Cape Maclear\" after his friend, the <span>astronomer</span> <span>Thomas Maclear</span>, who was Her Majesty's Astronomer at the <span>Cape of Good Hope</span>. In October 1875, a new mission, \"Livingstonia\", was set up by a group of members of the <span>Free Church of Scotland</span>. Before the missionaries arrived, the area was controlled by the <span>Muslim</span> <span>Yao people</span>. The graves of some of the missionaries are in Cape Maclear, overlooking the bay. Although Cape Maclear had a good harbour, the poor soil in the area, and the prevalence of the <span>tsetse fly</span>, meant a more suitable base had to be found; the mission moved to <span>Bandawe</span>, near <span>Chintheche</span>, in 1882.</p>","Bago (Myanmar)":"<p id=\"mwKA\">Various <span>Mon language</span> <span>chronicles</span> report widely divergent foundation dates of Bago, ranging from 573 CE to 1152 CE while the <i id=\"mwLQ\"><span>Zabu Kuncha</span></i>, an early 15th century Burmese administrative treatise, states that Pegu was founded in 1276/77 CE. The earliest extant evidence of Pegu as a place dates only to the late <span>Pagan period</span> (1212 and 1266) when it was still a small town, not even a provincial capital. After the collapse of the Pagan Empire, Bago became part of the breakaway <span>Kingdom of Martaban</span> by the 1290s.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Marlborough (New Zealand)":"<p id=\"mwKA\">Marlborough's geography can be roughly divided into four sections.

The most important of the plains lie in the south and south-west portions of Pyay, and extend along the whole length of the railway that runs between. There are, in addition large tracts of land covered by jungle, which are available for cultivation. The principal river is the Irrawaddy, which intersects the district from north to south; next in importance are the <span>Thani</span> and its tributaries and the Naweng system of rivers. In the hills near the capital the soil is of Tertiary formation, and in the plains it is an alluvial deposit.</p>\n<p id=\"mwLw\">Much debate surrounds the construction of Sri Ksetra. <span>Htin Aung</span> suggests that Pyu might have been founded in 78 CE, based on the Sanskrit / Pyu Era. <span>D. G. E. Hall</span> and <span>Gordon Luce</span>, however, claim that civilisation of the Irrawaddy Valley could not have been possible before the 4th century, thus, attributing the founding of Sri Ksetra to 638, from which the current Burmese Kawza Era begins.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Ouarzazate":"<p id=\"mwdw\">The kasbah-town of <span>Aït Benhaddou</span> is nearby.

These days the border to Algeria is closed, stopping the Timbuktu route.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mwQw\">For a long time, Ouarzazate was a small crossing point for African traders on their way to northern Morocco and Europe. During the French period, Ouarzazate expanded considerably as a garrison town, administrative centre and customs post. It is home to the kasbah of Taourirt, which was the casbah of the former <span>caïd</span> and later owned by <span>T'hami El Glaoui</span>.

Inside there is a cafe, as well as the Society of Malawi Library and Archive. The <span>Chichiri Museum</span> is located in the city. Carlsberg Brewery is a location where visitors can try the country's favourite drink, the \"Green\". This drink was created by a Danish foreign minister who visited Malawi during the independence celebration in 1966.</p>\n<p id=\"mweA\">Blantyre City, the largest commercial and industrial capital of Malawi, is in the Shire Highlands and geographical centre of the Southern Region of the country and lies 35° east of Greenwich Meridian and 15° 42\" south of the Equator. It is a transport communications node with road, rail and air links to all parts of the country and neighbouring countries of <span>Mozambique</span>, <span>Zimbabwe</span>, South Africa, <span>Zambia</span> and <span>Tanzania</span>. It covers an area of 228<span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" id=\"mwfQ\">&nbsp;</span>km.

The earliest description of Janakpur as a <span>pilgrimage</span> site dates to 1805. Earlier <span>archaeological</span> evidence of the presence of an ancient city has not been found. King <span>Janaka</span>'s palace is thought to have been located in ancient Janakpur as it is thought to be the capital of the <span>Kingdom of the Videhas</span>. According to the <span>Hindu</span> <span>Epic</span> <span>Ramayana</span>, he found a baby girl in a furrow, named her <span>Sita</span> and raised her as his daughter. When she was older, he offered her in marriage to anyone who was able to lift the bow of <span>Shiva</span>, left near Janakpur a thousand years earlier. Many royal suitors tried, but only <span>Rama</span>, prince of <span>Ayodhya</span>, could lift the bow.

The spacious palm oases, however, make an early settlement support (about 3000 BC) likely. Due to the growth of the desert, the settlement is threatened since the 2nd half of the 20th century by siltation, and the population is declining steadily. Until the end of the 1980s a special permit was required to enter the area because it is close to the strategically important border with Algeria.

The islands were sparsely inhabited by fishermen for centuries, although tourism now accounts for most economic activity.</p>\n\n\n\n","Pyin U Lwin":"<p id=\"mwKQ\">The town began as a military outpost established near a small <span>Shan</span> village with two dozen households on the <span>Lashio</span>-<span>Mandalay</span> trail between <span>Nawnghkio</span> and <span>Mandalay</span>. In 1897, a permanent military post was established in the town and later, because of its climate, it became a <span>hill station</span> and the summer capital of British Burma. The establishment in Burma (civil, commercial and military) would move to Maymyo during the hot season to escape from the high heat and humidity of Rangoon. During British rule and through the 1970s, Maymyo had a large <span>Anglo-Burmese</span> population, but this steadily declined. During the Japanese occupation, as many Anglos were concentrated in and around Maymyo, the Japanese incarcerated many of them for fear of their loyalty to the British very close to Maymyo. Today, Maymyo still has one of the larger populations of <span>Anglo-Burmese</span> in the country. The <span>British</span> named the location Maymyo, literally 'May's Town' in <span>Burmese</span>, after <span>Colonel May</span>, a veteran of the <span>Indian Rebellion of 1857</span> and commander of the <span>Bengal Regiment</span> temporarily stationed in the town in 1887.

The city is a resort town for visitors from Myanmar's major cities during the summertime and a popular stop for foreign <span>tourists</span> during the winter season.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Deir el Qamar":"<p id=\"mwGQ\">The oldest written reference to Deir el Qamar (Deir elcamar or Deir elchamar) goes back to 1257 and 1260 in the deeds of Julian of Shouf and Andrew of Shouf selling their lands and villages in their lordship of Shouf to the Theutonic Order as reported in Tabulae Ordinis Theutonici, a copy of which is kept in New York Public Library.\nDuring the 16th to 18th centuries, Deir al-Qamar was the capital and the residence of the <span>Emirate of Mount Lebanon</span>. It is also notable for its 15th-century <span>Fakhreddine Mosque</span>, <span>Fakhreddine II Palace</span>, and the palace of the Emir <span>Yusuf Shihab</span> - today housing the Municipal Council. The 17th century <span>Deir al-Qamar Synagogue</span> is also in the village, although closed to the public. During its peak, the city was the centre of Lebanese literary tradition.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Kidal":"<p id=\"mwFw\">On 30 March 2012, Kidal and its military base were captured by the <span>National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad</span> as part of the <span>Tuareg rebellion</span> for the independence of <span>Azawad</span>. A spokesman for the <span>Malian military junta</span> said \"To preserve the life of the people of Kidal, the military command decided not to prolong the battle\". Gao and <span>Timbuktu</span> were captured within the next 48 hours, and on 6 April, the <span>National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad</span> declared the independence of Azawad from Mali. In the course of the conflict the MNLA lost their control to Islamist militias. On 30 January 2013 <span>French</span> and Malian forces moved into the town to bring it back under government control.</p>\n\n\n\n","Nkhata Bay":"<p id=\"mwsQ\">Nkhata Bay is described by <span>Lonely Planet</span> as \"Caribbeanesque\" and a \"lush tropical indent\". There are several guesthouses and lodges for tourists in Nkhata Bay. In February 2005, the Malawian government announced plans to build ecolodges as a way of increasing <span>ecotourism</span> in the Nkhata Bay area. The diving school in Nkhata Bay offers the \"cheapest diving course in the world\" according to <i id=\"mwug\"><span>The Daily Telegraph</span></i>. Nkhata Bay tourism has a long history. It has been part of the overland backpackers route between east Africa and cape town but the number of backpackers have dropped considerably in recent years. Political issues in Zimbabwe has revised the overland backpacking route so that many people now go through Zambia or the Mozambique coast. The Heart Hotel was a local owned establishment in the local village where very low budget backpackers could get a room and breakfast for well under one US dollar. Nkhata Bay became a place where people could rest on a long trip and spend very little money. With the opening of Njajay Lodge the scene changed a little. The town along with backpackers culture shifted to catering to a traveller with more money to spend. While the village now has many places to stay the problem has become attracting people who now often travel though other countries or more easier accessed beaches in Malawi. Another shift that has reduced the amount of foreign visitors to Nkhata Bay is the increasing number of people travelling Africa by overland truck rather than independent backpackers travel. Overland trucks to do not come to Nkhata Bay but instead choose the beaches on Chinteche to the south. As a result, many of the local artists have moved their craft stalls to the Nkhata Bay/Chinteche road junction. This along with huge increases in international parcel rates from Malawi have made it increasing difficult for the talented local artist to make a living. Many artists now set up stalls directly outside of overland truck camps around Malawi understanding that backpackers can no longer afford to send famous Malawi chief chairs and masks home.</p>\n<p id=\"mwIA\">The ancestors of Nkhata Bay residents were the Tonga (Lakeside Tonga). In the 19th century the area suffered frequent attacks from the <span>Ngoni people</span>, who fled north to escape the rule of the <span>Zulu</span> king <span>Shaka</span>, in South Africa.</p>","Banc d'Arguin National Park":"<p id=\"mwfA\">The Coastal Zone, or Sub-Canarian Zone, extends the length of the approximately 754-kilometer-long Atlantic coast.

Both empires had the town of Gao as their capital. Apart from some Arabic epitaphs on tombstones discovered in 1939 at the cemetery of <span>Gao-Saney</span> (6<span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" id=\"mwew\">&nbsp;</span>km to the east of the city) there are no surviving indigenous written records that date from before the middle of the 17th century. Our knowledge of the early history of the town relies on the writings of Arabic geographers living in Morocco, Egypt and Andalusia, most of whom never visited the region. These authors referred to the town as Kawkaw or Kuku.<!-- They frequently borrow text from earlier accounts without acknowledging their sources. True, but not needed here--> The two key 17th century chronicles, the <i id=\"mwgA\"><span>Tarikh al-Sudan</span></i> and the <i id=\"mwgg\"><span>Tarikh al-fattash</span></i>, provide information on the town at the time of the <span>Songhai Empire</span> but they contain relatively little on the social and economic history. The chronicles do not, in general, acknowledge their sources.<!-- TF has its own problems but no need to mention them here --> Their accounts for the earlier periods are almost certainly based on oral tradition and for events before the second half of the 15th century they are likely to be less reliable. For these earlier periods, the two chronicles sometimes provide conflicting information.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Mawlamyine":"<p id=\"mwAj8\">\nMawlamyine provides a <span>multicultural</span> dimension despite a Buddhist <span>Mon</span> majority. <span>Buddhist cultural</span> dominance is as old as Mawlamyine, but the British <span>annexation</span> and American missionaries in the early 19th century introduced Christianity.

The foundation was named after the 16th-century farm Ersteling.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Cottonera":"<p id=\"mwGw\"><span>Birgu</span> has been settled since the time of the <span>Phoenicians</span>, but the current city dates back from the time of the <span>Order of Saint John</span>. Birgu was chosen as the capital city of Malta instead of <span>Mdina</span> upon the arrival of the Order in 1530. After the <span>1551 attack</span>, <span>Senglea</span> was built on the peninsula known as <i id=\"mwIg\">L'Isola</i>. In Birgu, <span>Fort Saint Angelo</span> was built on the site of the ancient Castrum Maris, and <span>Fort Saint Michael</span> was built on Senglea.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Andasibe-Mantadia National Park":"<p id=\"mwIg\">The <span>Analamazaotra (or Périnet) Special Reserve</span> (ASR), known locally as <i id=\"mwJA\">Andasibe</i> after the nearby village, was once part of the larger Mantadia National Park which also included Maromizaha Classified Forest to the southeast and Anosibe an’ala to the south. However logging and deforestation for farming has resulted in these parks now being isolated.</p>\n\n\n\n","Ilha de Mozambique":"<p id=\"mwNg\">Other notable buildings on the island include the Palace and Chapel of São Paulo, built in 1610 as a Jesuit College and subsequently used as the Governor's Residence, now a museum; the Museum of Sacred Art, housed in the Church of the Misericórdia run by the House of Mercy, displaying an excellent <span>Makonde</span> <span>crucifix</span>; the Church of Santo António; the Church of the Misericórdia; and the <span>Chapel of Nossa Senhora de Baluarte</span>. The island, now entirely urbanised, is also home to several <span>mosques</span> and a <span>Hindu temple</span>. A 3<span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" id=\"mwPA\">&nbsp;</span>km <span>bridge</span> was erected in the 1960s to connect it to the mainland.</p>\n\n\n<p id=\"mwEA\">Pottery found on Mozambique Island indicates that the town was founded no later than the fourteenth century. According to tradition, the original <span>Swahili</span> population came from <span>Kilwa</span>. The town's rulers had links with the rulers of both <span>Angoche</span> and <span>Quelimane</span> by the fifteenth century. In 1514, Duarte Barbosa noted that the town had a Muslim population and that they spoke the same Swahili dialect as Angoche. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Zomba":"<p id=\"mwSw\">The <span>Zomba Plateau</span> is Zomba's most famous feature. In some parts, it rises to 1800<span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" id=\"mwTQ\">&nbsp;</span>m in height and is covered with vast tracts of <span>African juniper</span> and <i id=\"mwTw\"><span>Widdringtonia</span></i>, and other mixed vegetation. The top of the plateau is criss-crossed by streams and is dotted with waterfalls and still lakes. The hike to the top of the Plateau is a popular tourist activity.</p>\n\n\n<p id=\"mwIQ\">The town's British colonial past is reflected in the architecture of its older buildings and homes. Zomba was once a hub for expatriates in Malawi. Its diverse cultural mix included British tobacco farmers and Dutch, German and <span>U.S</span>. emissaries. The British also established <span>Sir Harry Johnston</span> Primary School. The Zomba <span>Gymkhana</span> Club was once the focus for social activity in the expatriate community. However, in recent years, the club's appearance and reputation have been in decline. The Zomba Gymkhana Club was where the Malawi Rock Shandy was created by the head barman Shadrack in the 1960s. Next to the old parliament building is the botanical garden, which was established by the British, as well as the golf course in the city centre. At the southern entrance to the city, the <span>King's African Rifles</span> memorial is positioned right next to the M1.</p>","Tsetserleg":"<p id=\"mwGw\">Tsetserleg is an ancient cultural and commercial centre. It was once the seat of a monastery, built by the First Khalkh Zaya Pandita, Luvsanperenlei (1642–1715) (who should not be confused with <span>Zaya Pandita</span> Namkhaijantsan (1599–1662)). It consisted of the main Guden Süm, the Right, or Summer Semchin Temple, and the Left, or Winter Semchin Temple, all built in the early 1680s. The sixth Zaya Pandita, Jambatseren, was killed by the Communists in 1932, and the main Guden temple was turned into a museum. There is a seventh Zaya Pandita, but he mostly lives in Ulan Bator and visits only occasionally.</p>","Byblos":"<p id=\"mwAbY\">Byblos is re-emerging as an upscale touristic hub.  With its ancient <span>port</span>, <span>Phoenician</span>, Roman, and Crusader ruins, sandy beaches and the picturesque mountains that surround it make it an ideal tourist destination. The city is known for its fish restaurants, open-air bars, and outdoor cafes. Yachts cruise into its harbor today as they did in the 1960s and 1970s when <span>Marlon Brando</span> and <span>Frank Sinatra</span> were regular visitors to the city.\nByblos was crowned as the \"Arab Tour Capital\" for the year 2016 by the Lebanese minister of tourism in the Grand Serail in <span>Beirut</span>.\nByblos was chosen by <span>Condé Nast Traveler</span> as the second best city in the <span>Middle East</span> for 2012, beating <span>Tel Aviv</span> and <span>Dubai</span>, and by the <span>World Tourism Organization</span> as the best Arab tourist city for 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"mwnA\">Byblos is located about <span about=\"#mwt127\" typeof=\"mw:Transclusion\" data-mw=\"{&quot;parts&quot;:[{&quot;template&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;convert&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;./Template:Convert&quot;},&quot;params&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;42&quot;},&quot;2&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;km&quot;},&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;0&quot;},&quot;abbr&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;on&quot;},&quot;sp&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;us&quot;}},&quot;i&quot;:0}}]}\" id=\"mwnQ\">42</span><span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" about=\"#mwt127\">&nbsp;</span><span about=\"#mwt127\">km (26</span><span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" about=\"#mwt127\">&nbsp;</span><span about=\"#mwt127\">mi)</span> north of <span>Beirut</span>. It is attractive to archaeologists because of the successive layers of debris resulting from centuries of human habitation. It was first excavated by <span>Ernest Renan</span> in 1860, as published in his <i id=\"mwoA\"><span>Mission de Phénicie (1865–1874)</span></i>, then by <span>Pierre Montet</span> from 1921 until 1924, followed by <span>Maurice Dunand</span> from 1925 over a period of forty years. Renan's expedition was to \"provide the evidence that the city did not move and that Gebeil is Byblos\"</p>\n\n\n\n","Delft":"<p id=\"mw2Q\">Delft is well known for the <span>Delft pottery</span> <span>ceramic</span> products which were styled on the imported <span>Chinese</span> <span>porcelain</span> of the 17th century. The city had an early start in this area since it was a home port of the <span>Dutch East India Company</span>. It can still be seen at the pottery factories <span>De Koninklijke Porceleyne Fles (or Royal Delft)</span> and De Delftse Pauw, while new ceramics and ceramic art can be found at the <span>Gallery Terra Delft</span>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<!-- not needed ?

Until the 1950s, the journey from <span>Kathmandu</span> to Nepal's south was arduous as the area could only be reached by foot and took several weeks. Comfortable camps were set up for the <span>feudal</span> <span>big game hunters</span> and their entourage, where they stayed for a couple of months shooting hundreds of <span>tigers</span>, <span>rhinoceroses</span>, <span>leopards</span> and <span>sloth bears</span>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Beira":"<p id=\"mwHw\">Beira is located on the <span>Mozambique Channel</span>, an <span>arm</span> of the <span>Indian Ocean</span> located between <span>Madagascar</span> and <span>Mozambique</span>. The city sits north of the mouth of the convergence of two major rivers of Mozambique: the <span>Buzi River</span> and the <span>Pungwe River</span>.

Originally called Chiveve, after a local river, it was renamed to honor the <span>Portuguese Crown</span> prince Dom <span>Luís Filipe</span> who, in 1907, was the first member of the Portuguese royal family to visit Mozambique. Traditionally the Portuguese Crown prince carried the title of <span>Prince of Beira</span>, a <span>historical province</span> of <span>mainland Portugal</span>. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Nouadhibou":"<p id=\"mwHQ\">The city consists of four major areas: the <span>city centre</span>, including the <span>airport</span>; <span>Numerowatt</span> to the north; <span>Cansado</span>, the main residential area, to the south; and a <span>dormitory town</span> for the workers of the harbour facilities which are located a few kilometers south of the city, near the tip of the Ras Nouadhibou peninsula, at <span>Port Minéralier</span>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mwRw\">The town was established as a small fishing port, controlled by the Portuguese, the Dutch and finally the French. In 1907 by decree of the governor general of <span>French West Africa</span> <span>Ernest Roume</span>, it was renamed <i id=\"mwTA\">Port-Étienne</i> after the former French Minister of the Colonies <span>Eugène Étienne</span>. After Mauritania became independent in 1960, the town name changed to Nouadhibou.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Sossusvlei":"<p id=\"mwow\">As a consequence of its fascinating and surrealistic landscapes, Sossusvlei is one of the most photographed places in <span>Subsaharan Africa</span>. The area has been the setting of a number of commercials, music videos, and movies, especially of the <span>fantasy</span> genre; one of the most well-known examples is the <span>psychological thriller</span> <i id=\"mwpw\"><span>The Cell</span></i> (2000), where the Sossusvlei landscape is used to represent an <span>oneiric</span> <span>virtual reality</span>.</p>\n\n\n<p id=\"mwnQ\">Since Sossusvlei is possibly the foremost attraction of Namibia, much has been done by the Namibian authorities to support and facilitate tourism in the area. The asphalt road was built in the early 2000s (decade) to connect Sesriem and Sossusvlei's 2x4 parking is one of the very few non-urban metalled roads in Namibia. Numerous places of accommodation are found along the border of the National Park, between Sesriem and the nearest settlement, Solitaire. Recently, accommodation has been built inside the park. It is also possible to take scenic flights over the dunes, either with small planes (mainly from <span>Swakopmund</span> and <span>Walvis Bay</span>) or in <span>hot air balloons</span> (departing from <span>Sesriem</span> in the morning).</p>","Aoraki Mount Cook National Park":"<p id=\"mwVA\">More than 400 species of plants make up the vegetation in Aoraki/Mount Cook National Park, which include more than 100 introduced plant species such as the colourful <span>Russell lupin</span>, the <span>wild cherry</span> and <span>wilding pines</span>. Under normal circumstances, forest grows to about 1,300<span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" id=\"mwWA\">&nbsp;</span>m, however, most parts of the park are either at higher altitudes above the tree line or in the proglacial valleys such as the Hooker Valley and Tasman Valley, where the rocky soil of the valley floors and moraine walls do not support forest growth. As a result, the only pockets of forest and native <span>bush</span> in the park are along the southern edge of the Hooker Valley and the lower slopes of <span>Sealy Range</span>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mwJA\">The park stretches for about <span about=\"#mwt32\" typeof=\"mw:Transclusion\" data-mw=\"{&quot;parts&quot;:[{&quot;template&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;convert&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;./Template:Convert&quot;},&quot;params&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;60&quot;},&quot;2&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;km&quot;}},&quot;i&quot;:0}}]}\" id=\"mwJQ\">60 kilometres (37</span><span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" about=\"#mwt32\">&nbsp;</span><span about=\"#mwt32\">mi)</span> along the southwest-northeast direction of the <span>Southern Alps</span>, covering <span about=\"#mwt33\" typeof=\"mw:Transclusion\" data-mw=\"{&quot;parts&quot;:[{&quot;template&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;convert&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;./Template:Convert&quot;},&quot;params&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;722&quot;},&quot;2&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;km2&quot;},&quot;abbr&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;on&quot;}},&quot;i&quot;:0}}]}\" id=\"mwJw\">722</span><span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" about=\"#mwt33\">&nbsp;</span><span about=\"#mwt33\">km</span><span about=\"#mwt33\"> (279</span><span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" about=\"#mwt33\">&nbsp;</span><span about=\"#mwt33\">sq</span><span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" about=\"#mwt33\">&nbsp;</span><span about=\"#mwt33\">mi)</span> on the southeastern side of the main spine of the Alps.

The river flows over the spectacular <span>Huka Falls</span>, a short distance north of the town. Taupo is a centre of volcanic and <span>geothermal</span> activity and hot springs suitable for bathing are located at several places in the vicinity. The volcanic <span>Mount Tauhara</span> lies six kilometres (4<span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" id=\"mwLw\">&nbsp;</span>mi) to the east.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mwXQ\">Taupo is a tourist centre, particularly in the summer, as it offers panoramic views over the lake and to the volcanic mountains of <span>Tongariro National Park</span> to the south. It offers a number of tourist activities including <span>sky diving</span>, <span>jet boating</span>, <span>paragliding</span>, and <span>bungy jumping</span>.</p>\n\n\n\n","Redang":"<p id=\"mwGw\">In contrast to the neighbouring <span>Perhentian Islands</span>, Redang has a more upmarket image, as almost all accommodation on the <span>island</span> is resort-based. The largest beach is Pasir Panjang on the east side, featuring half a dozen resorts. The beach is covered with soft white sand. Coral and fish can be seen just a few metres from the beach. The other beach resorts are located in Teluk Dalam on the north and Teluk Kalong to the south. </p>\n \t\n","Tioman":"<p id=\"mwLw\">Tioman has been used for thousands of years by fishermen as an important navigation point and a source of fresh water and wood. During the past thousand years, it has played host to <span>Chinese</span>, <span>Arab</span>, and European trading ships, and often Chinese <span>porcelain</span> shards can be found on beaches around the island.</p>\n\n\n\n","Lüderitz":"<p id=\"mwZA\">The harbour has a very shallow rock bottom, making it unusable for modern <span>ships</span>; this led to <span>Walvis Bay</span> becoming the centre of the Namibian shipping industry. Recently, however, the addition of a new <span>quay</span> has allowed larger fishing vessels to dock at Lüderitz. The town has also re-styled itself in an attempt to lure <span>tourists</span> to the area, which includes a new <span>waterfront</span> area for <span>shops</span> and <span>offices</span>.</p>\n\n\n<p id=\"mwJw\">The bay on which Lüderitz is situated was first known to Europeans when <span>Bartolomeu Dias</span> encountered it in 1487. He named the bay <i id=\"mwKQ\"><span>Angra Pequena</span></i> (<span>Portuguese</span><span about=\"#mwt34\">: </span><i lang=\"pt\" about=\"#mwt34\">Small Bay</i><link rel=\"mw:PageProp/Category\" href=\"./Category:Articles_containing_Portuguese-language_text\" about=\"#mwt34\" id=\"mwLA\">) and erected a <span>padrão</span> (stone cross) on the southern peninsula. In the 18th century Dutch adventurers and scientists explored the area in search of minerals but did not have much success. Further exploration expeditions followed in the early 19th century during which the vast wildlife in the ocean was discovered. Profitable enterprises were set up, including <span>whaling</span>, <span>seal hunting</span>, fishing and <span>guano</span>-harvesting. Lüderitz thus began its life as a <span>trading post</span>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Rotorua":"<p id=\"mwNw\">The name Rotorua comes from <span>Māori</span>, the full name for the city and lake is <b id=\"mwOQ\">Te Rotorua-nui-a-Kahumatamomoe</b>. <i id=\"mwOg\">Roto</i> means 'lake' and <i id=\"mwOw\">rua</i> means 'two' or in this case 'second' – Rotorua thus meaning 'Second lake'. <span>Kahumatamomoe</span> was the uncle of the <span>Māori</span> chief <span>Ihenga</span>, the ancestral explorer of the <span>Te Arawa</span>. It was the second major lake the chief discovered, and he dedicated it to his uncle. It is the largest of a multitude of lakes found to the northeast, all connected with the Rotorua Caldera and nearby <span>Mount Tarawera</span>. The name can also mean the equally appropriate 'Crater lake'.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Mopti":"<p id=\"mwpQ\">The city is the subject of a 1999 documentary film, <i id=\"mwpg\"><span>L'Esprit de Mopti</span></i>. It is also the birthplace of <span>Slovak</span> celebrity <span>Ibrahim Maiga</span>.</p>\n<p id=\"mwFg\">Mopti lies on the right bank of the <span>Bani River</span>, a few hundred meters upstream of the confluence of the Bani with the <span>Niger River</span>. Between August and December when the rivers flood the <span>Inner Niger Delta</span>, the town becomes a series of islands connected by raised causeways. During this period the only road access to the town is along a 12<span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" id=\"mwGg\">&nbsp;</span>km causeway that links Mopti to <span>Sévaré</span>. Mopti lies to the west of the Dogon Plateau and is 66<span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" id=\"mwHA\">&nbsp;</span>km northwest of <span>Bandiagara</span> and 76<span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" id=\"mwHg\">&nbsp;</span>km north-northeast of <span>Djenné</span>.<!--all distances as the crow flies--> The town is the capital of the <span>Mopti Region</span> and the administrative center of the <span>Mopti Cercle</span>.</p>\n\n","Ohrid":"<p id=\"mwAcc\">There is a legend supported by observations by the 17th century Ottoman traveler <span>Evliya Çelebi</span> that there were 365 chapels within the town boundaries, one for every day of the year.

It is nicknamed the \"Pearl of the West\". While it is a modern city, it has kept many of the rural traditions of Jalisco, such as <span>mariachi</span> and a strong sense of <span>Catholicism</span>. Cultural tourism is one of the most important economic activities, especially in the historic center. Guadalajara is a center of learning with six universities, two culinary institutes and a thriving art scene. Guadalajara has twenty two museums, which include the Regional Museum of Jalisco, the Wax Museum, the Trompo Mágico children's museum and the Museum of Anthropology. The <span>Hospicio Cabañas</span> in the historic center is a <span>World Heritage Site</span>. For these attributes and others, the city was named an <span>American Capital of Culture</span> in 2005.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mwAtY\">Guadalajara has the third-largest economy and industrial infrastructure in Mexico and contributes 37% of the state of Jalisco's total gross production. Its economic base is strong and well diversified, mainly based on commerce and services, although the manufacturing sector plays a defining role. It is ranked in the top ten in Latin America in <span>gross domestic product</span> and the third highest ranking in Mexico. In its 2007 survey entitled \"Cities of the Future\", <i id=\"mwAtw\"><span>FDi magazine</span></i> ranked Guadalajara highest among major Mexican cities and designated Guadalajara as having the second strongest economic potential of any major North American city behind <span>Chicago</span>. <i id=\"mwAt8\">FDI</i> ranked it as the most business-friendly Latin American city in 2007.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Kuala Lumpur":"<p id=\"mwAb8\">The geography of Kuala Lumpur is characterised by the huge <span>Klang Valley</span>.

In the center of the city the remains of a stone fortress can be found, the Zawiy Maalainin, which enclosed a mosque. The Maalainin lived there from 1830 until 1912. It was made a capital and religious center in 1902 by <span>shaykh</span> <span>Ma al-'Aynayn</span>, in what was then <span>Spanish Sahara</span>. The location of the city was intended to ensure its becoming a <span>caravan</span> trade hub in the sparsely populated <span>Sahara desert</span>. The enlargement of Smara was carried out by local <span>Sahrawis</span> as well as craftsmen sent by the <span>sultan</span> <span>Hassan I</span>. In 1902, shaykh Ma al-'Aynayn moved to Smara and declared it his holy capital. Among other things, he created an important <span>Islamic</span> library, and the town became a center of religious learning.</p>\n\n\n\n","Wewak":"<p id=\"mwHA\">The old centre of the town is on a small peninsula, with the rest of the urban area occupying a narrow band of flat land between the ocean and the coastal range of mountains that emerges a short distance inland.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mwEA\">Between 1943 and 1945, during <span>World War II</span>, Wewak was the site of the largest <span>Japanese</span> airbase in mainland New Guinea. The base was subjected to repeated bombing by Australian and American forces, most notably in <span>one massive attack</span> on 17 August 1943. Directly to the west of the town centre is a peninsula known as <span>Cape Wom</span>, which was the site of the surrender of Japanese forces in New Guinea on 13 September 1945. The site now houses a small memorial. The former Japanese airfield is still in use as the <span>Wewak International Airport</span>. \nIn August 1945 two war crimes trials were held near Wewak for mutilation and cannibalism.

According to tradition, Ziguinchor's name and meaning comes from the time when Portuguese traders and explorers came to the region to form a trading post, and derives from <span>Portuguese</span> <i id=\"mwIg\">Cheguei e choram</i>, \"I came and they cry\".  The local people, seeing the Europeans, began crying, thinking they were about to be enslaved. The Portuguese objective was to form a trading post and a friendship alliance with the local king. The Portuguese objective was trade with the kingdom of Casamanse, a loyal friend, described by chroniclers as the mostly friendly kingship towards the Portuguese along the Guinean coast. The king started to live in European manner, with table, chairs and western clothing and, in the court, there were several Portuguese merchants. One of the commodities for trade were slaves, and Ziguinchor became a <span>slave port</span> during much of the Portuguese rule.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Abha":"<p id=\"mwPQ\">The Saudi government has promoted Abha as a tourist destination.

Marrakesh was founded in 1062 (454 in the <span>Hijri calendar</span>) by <span>Abu Bakr ibn Umar</span>, chieftain and second cousin of the <span>Almoravid</span> king <span>Yusuf ibn Tashfin</span> (c. 1061–1106). Under the berber dynasty of the Almoravids, pious and learned warriors from the desert, numerous mosques and <span>madrasas</span> (Quranic schools) were built, developing the community into a trading centre for the <span>Maghreb</span> and sub-Saharan Africa. Marrakesh grew rapidly and established itself as a cultural and religious centre, supplanting <span>Aghmat</span>, which had long been the capital of <span>Haouz</span>. Andalusian craftsmen from <span>Cordoba</span> and <span>Seville</span> built and decorated numerous palaces in the city, developing the <span>Umayyad</span> style characterised by carved domes and cusped arches. This Andalusian influence merged with designs from the Sahara and West Africa, creating a unique style of architecture which was fully adapted to the Marrakesh environment. Yusuf ibn Tashfin completed the city's first mosque (the <span>Ben Youssef mosque</span>, named after his son), built houses, minted coins, and brought gold and silver to the city in caravans. The city became the capital of the Almoravid Emirate, stretching from the shores of <span>Senegal</span> to the centre of <span>Spain</span> and from the Atlantic coast to <span>Algiers</span>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<!--As a trading center, Marrakesh had once influenced political polarisation of the western Maghreb in 1947, after Marrakesh was established, due to the termination of Marinid Dynasty, Wattasid rulers getting to Fez and Saadi’s (hierarchy traced to the prophet Mohhamed’s period) from the south. In the late 15th century the Portuguese took advantage of ongoing trade and territorial disputes to establish a number of outposts in Morocco in the cities of [[Azemmour]] (1486) and [[Safi, Morocco|Safi]] (1488) on the pretext of military protection.

At the end of the 19th century, David had six streets, but only four were populated, making up the city center, in the sector currently known as Barrio Bolívar.

The total area is 1,656 km2 (639.4 sq mi).</p>\n<p id=\"mwIQ\">The municipality of El Castillo began with the construction of the Fortress of the Immaculate Conception on the southern bank of the San Juan River, approximately 6 kilometers from the <span>present-day border</span> with <span>Costa Rica</span>. This was part of a series of <span>fortifications</span> built along the San Juan River in order to defend against <span>pirate</span> attacks upon the city of <span>Granada</span> (which can be reached by navigating upstream from the <span>Caribbean Sea</span> along the San Juan River into <span>Lake Nicaragua</span>). Construction of the fortress, initially named <i id=\"mwKw\">Fortaleza de la Limpia Pura e Inmaculada Concepción</i> (now known as the <span><i id=\"mwLQ\">Castillo de la Inmaculada Concepción</i></span>, or Fortress of the Immaculate Conception), was begun on March 10, 1673, and completed in 1675.

Based on the western part of the county, it is classified as the'Inner kumgang' in the west and the 'Outer kumgang' in the east. The area on the east side of the Yeongeum River is called 'Hae kumgang'. The main peak of Mt. Kŭmgang is Pirobong, and more than 60,000 peaks over 1,000 meters. The combination of large and small peaks makes it difficult to measure. The ancestors were called 12,000 peaks. Many scenic spots in the area are designated as natural monuments of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The southern part of the'Outer kumgang' is also called 'New gumgang'. There are 11 'Outer kumgang', 8 'Inner kumgang' and 3 'Hae kumgang', but not all of them have been opened yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mwww\">Koreans have perceived Kŭmgangsan as their muse since well before the Middle Ages. Practically every poet and artist who lived during the Joseon dynasty (1392-1910) made a pilgrimage to Kŭmgangsan.

The treaty transferred most of the <span>Slovene</span>-inhabited areas of the <span>Province of Gorizia</span> to Yugoslavia. The town of <span>Gorizia</span> itself, however, remained under Italian rule. The new border cut the city off from its northern and eastern suburbs. Around 40% of the municipality's territory was transferred to Yugoslavia, including the suburbs of <span>Solkan</span>, <span>Šempeter</span>, <span>Kromberk</span>, <span>Rožna Dolina</span>, and <span>Pristava</span>. Together, these areas had a population of around 10,000 (almost exclusively Slovenes, with a tiny <span>Friulian</span>-speaking minority), or around one fifth of the municipality's population. However, they lacked a cohesive structure, and were poorly connected. In order to overcome this problem, the Communist authorities of the <span>Socialist Republic of Slovenia</span> decided to build a new settlement that would connect these suburbs into a new urban space. The new town was called Nova Gorica or \"New Gorizia\". The project had the personal backing of Marshal <span>Tito</span>, Yugoslavia's Communist leader. The project was commissioned to the Slovenian architect <span>Edvard Ravnikar</span>, a former pupil of <span>Le Corbusier</span>.

In the Caldera region you can find <span>petroglyphs</span> (a rock carving, especially a prehistoric one) that are evidence of the ancient settlements in the area. During the Spanish colonization, the highlands area was an isolated refuge for the indigenous tribes like the Ngöbe and the Misquito due to the topographic terrain. The colonization of Boquete only began in earnest in the second half of the nineteenth century, by locals from Bugaba, Gualaca, and David, and foreigners from Yugoslavia, France, Germany, and other European countries. Colonizers also arrived from the United States, starting the first coffee plantations and agricultural farms.

For a number of years early in its history, the sizable <span>United States</span> émigré community called the town Aspinwall after Panama Railroad promoter <span>William Henry Aspinwall</span>, while the city's <span>Hispanic</span> community called it Colón in honor of <span>Christopher Columbus</span>. The city was founded on the western end of a treacherously marshy islet known as Manzanillo Island. As part of the construction of the Panama Railroad, the island was connected to the Panamanian mainland by a causeway and part of the island was drained to allow the erection of permanent buildings.</p>\n\n\n\n","Maradi":"<p id=\"mwLA\">The city is divided into three urban municipalities: <span>Maradi I</span>, <span>Maradi II</span> and <span>Maradi III</span>. Maradi is centred on the <i id=\"mwMA\">Grand-marché</i>, a large daily market of wholesale, retail, and agricultural goods from across south central Niger and also the cross-border trade with Nigeria. Some of the districts in the town include Zaria and Sabon Gari in the north, and to the west Mokoya, Dan Gouleye, Bagalam, Yandaka, Maradawa, Hassao and Limantchi.</p>\n<p id=\"mwDw\">Originally part of <span>Katsina</span>, a <span>Hausa</span> state, it became independent in the 19th century. From the early 19th century, Maradi was home to one of several Hausa traditional rump states, formed by rulers and nobility who fled the rise of the <span>Sokoto Caliphate</span>. Elements of the Katsina ruling class continued to claim the area as the seat of a Katsina state in exile ruled by the <i id=\"mwFw\">Sarkin Katsina Maradi</i>. Maradi was constrained by the more powerful <span>Gobir</span> exilic state to the west, the <span>Sultanate of Damagaram</span> based at <span>Zinder</span> to the east, and Sokoto to the south. The arrival of the French in 1899 saw the bloody destruction of the town by the <span>Voulet-Chanoine Mission</span>, but later the town recovered to become an important regional centre of commerce by the 1950s. </p>\n\n\n\n","Trobriand Islands":"<p id=\"mwFQ\">The Trobriands consist of four main islands, the largest being Kiriwina Island, and the others being Kaileuna, Vakuta and Kitava.

Other than some elevation on Kiriwina, the islands are flat coral atolls and \"remain hot and humid throughout the year, with frequent rainfall.\"</p>\n<p id=\"mwIg\">The first European visitor to the islands was the French ship <span><i id=\"mwJA\">Espérance</i></span> in 1793. The ship's navigator, <span>Antoine Bruni d'Entrecasteaux</span>, named them after his first lieutenant, <span>Denis de Trobriand</span>. The first European to settle in the Trobriand islands was a <span>Methodist</span> minister who moved to the island of Kiriwina in 1894. He was followed a decade later by colonial officers from Australia who set up a governmental station nearby, and soon a small colony began to be set up by foreign traders on the island. Then in the 1930s, the Sacred Heart Catholic Mission set up a settlement containing a primary school nearby. It was following this European colonisation that the name \"Trobriand\" was legally adopted for this group of islands.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n","Huascarán National Park":"<p id=\"mwZA\">Huascarán National Park protects the Cordillera Blanca, which is the world's highest tropical mountain range.

On February 18, 1966 a government resolution prohibiting the logging and hunting of native species in the area of the Cordillera Blanca was issued. Later that year, the Patronage of Huascarán National Park was formed in <span>Yungay</span>. In 1967, Curry Slaymaker and Joel Albrecht, <span>Peace Corps</span> volunteers, formulated delimitation proposal on an area of 85,000 hectares; and simultaneously, the Forest Regional Service of <span>Huaraz</span> established the <span>vicuña</span> and <span>queen-of the-Andes</span> surveillance zone for an area of approximately 10,000 hectares.

Everyone will come together and sit around the plate and eat with their hands. Some famous dishes include Cebbu Jën (Tiéboudienne) and Yassa. The etiquette of people in Dakar is very simple but very vital. To not greet someone upon sight is to portray rudeness and oftentimes ignorance. Due to French colonialism the children of Dakar have a unique school system. The school will get a break at about midday and return home to get some rest. Since the population is majority Muslim there are daily activities such as going to the mosque at noon prayer and attending the mosque on Fridays.

The main problem encountered in the exit through the <span>Río de la Plata</span> was the excessively expensive freight, which made the exported products commercially uncompetitive. In 1955, the Mixed Paraguayan-Brazilian Commission was set up to boost the highway to the East, and in 1956 a reconnaissance flight was made on Alto Paraná. The construction of a road route to the <span>Paraná River</span> bank was led by Captain Porfirio Pereira Ruiz Díaz, who supervised several army units in the building of a 200-kilometre section from <span>Coronel Oviedo</span>.<link rel=\"mw:PageProp/Category\" href=\"./Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements\" about=\"#mwt22\" typeof=\"mw:Transclusion\" data-mw=\"{&quot;parts&quot;:[{&quot;template&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;fact&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;./Template:Fact&quot;},&quot;params&quot;:{&quot;date&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;December 2019&quot;}},&quot;i&quot;:0}}]}\" id=\"mwOA\"><link rel=\"mw:PageProp/Category\" href=\"./Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_December_2019\" about=\"#mwt22\"></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Tagbilaran":"<p id=\"mwoA\">The city is a start-off point to Bohol province's attractions: the Chocolate Hills, tarsiers, white sandy beaches, dive spots, heritage sites and old stone churches.

Though PNG is filled with resources, the lack of development led foreign countries to take over some sites. Continuing foreign demand for PNG's resources led the United States to set up an oil company that began to export in 2004. This was the largest project in PNG's history. The project increased the potential to triple PNG's export revenue. Papua New Guinea gained much assistance from Australia and was offered two hundred million dollars a year in aid, and many countries such as Singapore, Japan and China have also played a great part in PNG's industry business.

In the late 16th or early 17th centuries, the kingdom of Rwanda was invaded by the <span>Banyoro</span> and the kings forced to flee westward, leaving Kigali and eastern Rwanda in the hands of Bugesera and Gisaka. The formation in the 17th century of a new Rwandan dynasty by mwami <span>Ruganzu Ndori</span>, followed by eastward invasions and the conquest of Bugesera, marked the beginning of the Rwandan kingdom's dominance in the area.

Kraków has 28 museums and <span>public art</span> galleries. Among them is the <span>Czartoryski Museum</span> featuring works by <span>Leonardo da Vinci</span> and <span>Rembrandt</span> as well as the <span>EUROPEUM - European Culture Centre</span> and the <span>Archaeological Museum of Kraków</span> whose collection highlights include the <span>Zbruch Idol</span> and the <span>Bronocice Pot</span>.</p>\n\n\n<p id=\"mwBoA\">According to recent official statistics, in 2017 Kraków was visited by around 12.9 million tourists including 3 million foreign travellers. The visitors spent over 5.4 billion <span>złoty</span> (€1.2 billion) in the city (without travel costs and pre-booked accommodations). Most foreign tourists came from Germany (13,2%), Great Britain (13,1%), Italy (11%), France (8,5%) and Spain (8%). The Kraków tour-guide from the Lesser Poland Visitors Bureau indicated that not all statistics are recorded due to considerable number of those who come, staying in readily available private rooms paid by cash, especially from <span>Eastern Europe</span>.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"gallery mw-gallery-packed\" typeof=\"mw:Extension/gallery\" about=\"#mwt1009\"

Both the castle and the town (named Marienburg in German and Malborg or Malbork in Polish) were named for their patron saint, the <span>Virgin Mary</span>. This fortified <span>castle</span> became the seat of the Teutonic Order and <span>Europe</span>'s largest <span>Gothic</span> fortress. During the <span>Thirteen Years' War</span>, the castle of Marienburg was pawned by the Teutonic Order to their imperial soldiers from <span>Bohemia</span>. They sold the castle in 1457 to King <span>Casimir IV</span> of <span>Poland</span> in lieu of indemnities. From 1457 to 1772 the castle was one of Poland's royal residences. Polish Kings often stayed in the castle, especially when travelling to the nearby city of <span>Gdańsk</span>. Also astronomer <span>Nicolaus Copernicus</span> visited the castle. From 1568 the castle also housed the Polish Admiralty (<i id=\"mwOw\">Komisja Morska</i>) and in 1584 one of the Polish Royal Mints was established here.

Statues and paintings in these caves date back to the 1st century BC. But the paintings and statues were repaired and repainted in the 11th, 12th, and 18th century AD.  The caves in the city provided refuge to <span>King Valagamba</span> (also called <i id=\"mwKg\">Vattagamini Abhaya</i>) in his 14-year-long exile from the <span>Anuradapura</span> kingdom. <span>Buddhist monks</span> meditating in the caves of Dambulla at that time provided the exiled king protection from his enemies.

It was sold over to the now defunct Caroni (1975) Ltd when sugar was the main export commodity for Trinidad and Tobago, and was part of the Woodford Lodge Estate that is home to several buildings including the homes of several ex-Caroni workers.Construction of the <span>Trinidad Government Railway</span> helped the town grow.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Addo Elephant National Park":"<p id=\"mwWw\">In 2018 the highest visitor count in the park's 87-year history was recorded.

These pirates used the Escondido River to rest, to repair damages and to be provisioned. By then, the territory of the present municipality was populated by the native towns of Kukra and Branch. In 1602 one of these soldiers of fortune chose the bay of Bluefields as his center of operations due to its tactical advantages, a <span>Dutchman</span> named <span>Blauvelt</span>, and from him originates the name of the municipality.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Costa del Sol":"<p id=\"mwHA\">The Costa del Sol includes the city of <span>Málaga</span> and also the towns of <span>Torremolinos</span>, <span>Benalmádena</span>, <span>Fuengirola</span>, <span>Mijas</span>, <span>Marbella</span>, <span>San Pedro de Alcántara</span>, <span>Estepona</span>, <span>Manilva</span>, <span>Casares</span>, <span>Rincón de la Victoria</span>, <span>Vélez-Málaga</span>, <span>Nerja</span>, <span>Frigiliana</span> and <span>Torrox</span>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n","Ulleungdo":"<p id=\"mwXg\">Favorite activities for tourists are <span>hiking</span>, <span>fishing</span>, and eating <span>hoe</span> (a Korean raw fish dish).

As time passed, a woman named May who commanded superior number of boats and crewmen emerged as Ghilan's main adversary. In an incident in which both crews were attempting to harvest the same pearl bed, May taunted Ghilan as her ship raced past his. This incensed Ghilan, who set out to discover a way to best his competitor. While observing a grasshopper, Ghilan took note of how its wings worked, and applied the same principle to his boats, giving rise to the sail. This enabled his boats to travel at higher speeds, allowing him to outpace May's boats to the densest pearl beds. The myth is typically presented in five sequences and is unlike most other known <span>Bedouin</span> stories.

This location is now known as the Casco Viejo (Old Quarter) of the city.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Cagayan de Oro":"<p id=\"mwAbk\">There are several notable events in the city. Each barangay or <span>barrio</span> has its own feast locally known as <i id=\"mwAbs\">Fiesta</i> (or <span>festivals</span>) honoring their patron saints after achieving recognition in their own rights.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mwAQA\">Cagayan de Oro is located along the north central coast of <span>Mindanao</span>, the second-largest island in the Philippine archipelago.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Managua":"<p id=\"mwAdA\">Managua is Nicaragua's <span>cultural capital</span>, boasting several restaurants, theaters, museums, and a few shopping centers. The city is also home to many communities of immigrants and <span>ex-pats</span> from countries including but not limited to <span>Taiwan</span>, China, Germany, the United States, <span>Palestine</span>, and Latin American countries. <link rel=\"mw:PageProp/Category\" href=\"./Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements\" about=\"#mwt374\" typeof=\"mw:Transclusion\" data-mw=\"{&quot;parts&quot;:[{&quot;template&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;citation needed&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;./Template:Citation_needed&quot;},&quot;params&quot;:{&quot;date&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;August 2012&quot;}},&quot;i&quot;:0}}]}\" id=\"mwAdc\"><link rel=\"mw:PageProp/Category\" href=\"./Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_August_2012\" about=\"#mwt374\"></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mwkw\">Managua is located on the southern shores of Lake Xolotlán, also known as <span>Lake Managua</span>. Lake Xolotlán contains the same fish species as larger <span>Lake Cocibolca</span> in southeastern Nicaragua, except for the freshwater sharks found exclusively in the latter. Once a Managuan scenic highlight, the lake has been polluted from the dumping of chemical and waste water since 1927. A new sewer system and the redirecting of waste water to a new <span>waste water treatment</span> plant at Las Mercedes funded by the German government to decontaminate the lake is expected to be the largest in Central America and was inaugurated in 2009.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Doha":"<p id=\"mwBE8\">Doha was chosen as the <span>Arab Capital of Culture</span> in <span>2010</span>. Cultural weeks organized by the Ministry of Culture, which featured both Arab and non-Arab cultures, were held in Doha from April to June to celebrate the city's selection.</p>\n\n\n<p id=\"mwAXY\">Doha is located on the central-east portion of Qatar, bordered by the <span>Persian Gulf</span> on its coast. Its elevation is <span about=\"#mwt466\" typeof=\"mw:Transclusion\" data-mw=\"{&quot;parts&quot;:[{&quot;template&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;convert&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;./Template:Convert&quot;},&quot;params&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;10&quot;},&quot;2&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;m&quot;},&quot;abbr&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;on&quot;}},&quot;i&quot;:0}}]}\" id=\"mwAXg\">10</span><span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" about=\"#mwt466\">&nbsp;</span><span about=\"#mwt466\">m (33</span><span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" about=\"#mwt466\">&nbsp;</span><span about=\"#mwt466\">ft)</span>. Doha is highly urbanized. <span>Land reclamation</span> off the coast has added 400 hectares of land and 30<span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" id=\"mwAXw\">&nbsp;</span>km of coastline. Half of the 22<span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" id=\"mwAX8\">&nbsp;</span>km² of surface area which <span>Hamad International Airport</span> was constructed on was reclaimed land. The geology of Doha is primarily composed of weathered unconformity on the top of the <span>Eocene</span> period Dammam Formation, forming <span>dolomitic</span> <span>limestone</span>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n","Galicia":"<p id=\"mwAoA\">Galicia has a surface area of <span about=\"#mwt280\" typeof=\"mw:Transclusion\" data-mw=\"{&quot;parts&quot;:[{&quot;template&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;convert&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;./Template:Convert&quot;},&quot;params&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;29574&quot;},&quot;2&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;km2&quot;},&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;sqmi&quot;}},&quot;i&quot;:0}}]}\" id=\"mwAoE\">29,574 square kilometres (11,419</span><span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" about=\"#mwt280\">&nbsp;</span><span about=\"#mwt280\">sq</span><span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" about=\"#mwt280\">&nbsp;</span><span about=\"#mwt280\">mi)</span>. Its northernmost point, at 43°47′N, is <span>Estaca de Bares</span> (also the northernmost point of Spain); its southernmost, at 41°49′N, is on the Portuguese border in the <span>Baixa Limia-Serra do Xurés Natural Park</span>. The easternmost longitude is at 6°42′W on the border between the province of <span>Ourense</span> and the <span>Castilian-Leonese</span> <span>province of Zamora</span>) its westernmost at 9°18′W, reached in two places: the A Nave Cape in <span>Fisterra</span> (also known as Finisterre), and Cape Touriñán, both in the province of A Coruña.</p>\n\n\n<p id=\"mwBII\">In comparison to the other regions of Spain, the major economic benefit of Galicia is its fishing Industry. Galicia is a land of economic contrast. While the western coast, with its major population centers and its fishing and manufacturing industries, is prosperous and increasing in population, the rural hinterland—the provinces of <span>Ourense</span> and <span>Lugo</span>—is economically dependent on traditional agriculture, based on small landholdings called <i id=\"mwBIU\">minifundios</i>. However, the rise of tourism, sustainable forestry and organic and traditional agriculture are bringing other possibilities to the Galician economy without compromising the preservation of the natural resources and the local culture.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Kazan":"<p id=\"mwAWA\">Kazan is one of the largest industrial and financial centers of Russia, and a leading city of the <span>Volga economic region</span> in construction and accumulated investment. City's <span>Gross Regional Product</span> had reached 380 billion rubles in 2011.</p>\n\n\n\n","Kristiansand":"<p id=\"mwBQs\">The <span>Kristiansand Symphony Orchestra</span>, Chamber Orchestra and Wind Ensemble merged in 2003. The orchestra now performs at the <span>Kilden Performing Arts Centre</span>, which opened in January 2012. This is also the new home of <span>Agder Theatre</span>, founded in 1991.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mw3A\">Kristiansand is strategically located on the <span>Skagerrak</span>, and until the opening of the <span>Kiel Canal</span> between the <span>North Sea</span> and the <span>Baltic</span> was very important militarily and geopolitically. This meant that for centuries it served as a military stronghold, first as <span>Harald Fairhair</span>'s royal residence, then as a Danish-Norwegian fortress, and later as a garrison town. Kristiansand is a gateway to and from the continent, with ferry service to Denmark and a terminus of the railway line along the southern edge of South Norway.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Porto":"<p id=\"mwBKQ\">In 2001, Porto shared the designation <span>European Culture Capital</span>. In the scope of these events, the construction of the major concert hall space <span>Casa da Música</span>, designed by the <span>Dutch</span> architect <span>Rem Koolhaas</span>, was initiated and finished in 2005.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mwASY\">In 1996, <span>UNESCO</span> recognised Porto's historic centre as a <span>World Heritage Site</span>. Among the architectural highlights of the city, <span>Porto Cathedral</span> is the oldest surviving structure, together with the small <span>romanesque</span> <span>Church of Cedofeita</span>, the <span>gothic</span> <span>Igreja de São Francisco</span> (Church of <span>Saint Francis</span>), the remnants of the <span>city walls</span> and a few 15th-century houses. The <span>baroque</span> style is well represented in the city in the elaborate gilt work <span>interior decoration</span> of the churches of St. Francis (<i id=\"mwATQ\">São Francisco</i>) and St. Claire (<i id=\"mwATU\">Santa Clara</i>), the churches of Mercy (<i id=\"mwATY\">Misericórdia</i>) and of the Clerics (<i id=\"mwATc\"><span>Clérigos</span></i>), the <span>Episcopal Palace of Porto</span>, and others. The <span>neoclassicism</span> and <span>romanticism</span> of the 19th and 20th centuries also added interesting monuments to the landscape of the city, like the magnificent Stock Exchange Palace (<i id=\"mwATw\"><span>Palácio da Bolsa</span></i>), the Hospital of <span>Saint Anthony</span>, the Municipality, the buildings in the <span>Liberdade Square</span> and the <i id=\"mwAUA\">Avenida dos Aliados</i>, the tile-adorned <span>São Bento Train Station</span> and the gardens of the Crystal Palace (<i id=\"mwAUI\">Palácio de Cristal</i>).

The architectural styles in Lagos are diverse and ranges from tropical, vernacular to colonial European and ultramodern buildings or a mixture. Brazilian style architecture brought by the creoles is evident in buildings such as Water House and  Shitta Bey Mosque. Skyscrapers and most high rise buildings are centered on the islands while the mainland has some high rise buildings. In recent years, the Lagos State government has renovated existing parks and green areas, with a long term goal of expansion. Many good quality buildings are interspersed across the city.</p>\n<p id=\"mwAQ4\">Lagos is loosely classified into two main geographical areas—the \"Island\" and the \"Mainland\".</p>\n\n","Islamabad":"<p id=\"mwAsw\">Islamabad is home to many migrants from other regions of Pakistan and has a cultural and religious diversity of considerable antiquity.

The imprint of Spanish and Roman Catholic culture is evident. The city's most famous landmark is <span>Magellan's Cross</span>. This cross, now housed in a chapel, is reputed to have been erected by <span>Ferdinand Magellan</span> (Fernão Magalhães) when he arrived in the Philippines in 1521. It was encased in hollow <span>tindalo wood</span> in 1835 upon the order of the Augustinian Bishop Santos Gómez Marañon to prevent devotees from taking it home chip by chip. The same bishop restored the present template or kiosk, located at Magallanes Street between the City Hall and Colegio del Santo Niño.

The downtown districts of <span>Saddar</span> and <span>Clifton</span> contain early 20th-century architecture, ranging in style from the <span>neo-classical</span> <span>KPT</span> building to the <span>Sindh High Court</span> Building.  Karachi acquired its first neo-Gothic or Indo-Gothic buildings when <span>Frere Hall</span>, <span>Empress Market</span> and <span>St. Patrick's Cathedral</span> were completed. The <span>Mock Tudor</span> architectural style was introduced in the <span>Karachi Gymkhana</span> and the Boat Club. <span>Neo-Renaissance architecture</span> was popular in the 19th century and was the architectural style for St. Joseph's Convent (1870) and the <span>Sind Club</span> (1883). The classical style made a comeback in the late 19th century, as seen in <span>Lady Dufferin Hospital</span> (1898) and the <span>Cantt. Railway Station</span>. While <span>Italianate</span> buildings remained popular, an eclectic blend termed <span>Indo-Saracenic</span> or Anglo-Mughal began to emerge in some locations.\nThe local mercantile community began acquiring impressive structures. Zaibunnisa Street in the <span>Saddar</span> area (known as Elphinstone Street in British days) is an example where the mercantile groups adopted the <span>Italianate</span> and <span>Indo-Saracenic</span> style to demonstrate their familiarity with Western culture and their own. The <span>Hindu Gymkhana</span> (1925) and <span>Mohatta Palace</span> are examples of Mughal revival buildings. The Sindh Wildlife Conservation Building, located in Saddar, served as a Freemasonic Lodge until it was taken over by the government. There are talks of it being taken away from this custody and being renovated and the Lodge being preserved with its original woodwork and ornate wooden staircase.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mwAV0\">Karachi is located on the coastline of Sindh province in southern Pakistan, along a natural harbour on the <span>Arabian Sea</span>.

The city has long been the portal of entry of Western concepts and material goods, which have been adopted and blended with Thai values to various degrees by its residents. This is most evident in the lifestyles of the expanding middle class. <span>Conspicuous consumption</span> serves as a display of economic and social status, and shopping centres are popular weekend hangouts. Ownership of electronics and consumer products such as mobile phones is ubiquitous. This has been accompanied by a degree of secularism, as religion's role in everyday life has rather diminished. Although such trends have spread to other urban centres, and, to a degree, the countryside, Bangkok remains at the forefront of social change.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mwAxw\">Bangkok is one of the world's top tourist destinations.

Bangkok was also named \"World's Best City\" by <i id=\"mwAyc\"><span>Travel + Leisure</span></i> magazine's survey of its readers for four consecutive years, from 2010 to 2013.\nAs the main gateway through which visitors arrive in Thailand, Bangkok is visited by the majority of international tourists to the country. Domestic tourism is also prominent. The Department of Tourism recorded 26,861,095 Thai and 11,361,808 foreign visitors to Bangkok in 2010. Lodgings were made by 15,031,244 guests, who occupied 49.9 percent of the city's 86,687 hotel rooms.

To appear better integrated into the Roman Empire, some Palmyrenes adopted Greco-Roman names, either alone or in addition to a second native name. The extent of Greek influence on Palmyra's culture is debated. Scholars interpreted the Palmyrenes' Greek practices differently; many see those characters as a superficial layer over a local essence. Palmyra's senate was an example; although Palmyrene texts written in Greek described it as a \"<span>boule</span>\" (a Greek institution), the senate was a gathering of non-elected tribal elders (a Near-Eastern assembly tradition). Others view Palmyra's culture as a fusion of local and Greco-Roman traditions.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mwlw\">The city of Palmyra lies <span about=\"#mwt119\" typeof=\"mw:Transclusion\" data-mw=\"{&quot;parts&quot;:[{&quot;template&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;convert&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;./Template:Convert&quot;},&quot;params&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;215&quot;},&quot;2&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;km&quot;},&quot;abbr&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;on&quot;}},&quot;i&quot;:0}}]}\" id=\"mwmA\">215</span><span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" about=\"#mwt119\">&nbsp;</span><span about=\"#mwt119\">km (134</span><span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" about=\"#mwt119\">&nbsp;</span><span about=\"#mwt119\">mi)</span> northeast of the Syrian capital, <span>Damascus</span>; along with an expanded hinterland of several settlements, farms and forts, the city is part of the region known as the Palmyrene. The city is located in an <span>oasis</span> surrounded by <span>palms</span> (of which twenty varieties have been reported). Two mountain ranges overlook the city; the northern <span>Palmyrene mountain belt</span> from the north and the southern Palmyrene mountains from the southwest. In the south and the east Palmyra is exposed to the Syrian Desert. A small <span>wadi</span> (<span>al-Qubur</span>) crosses the area, flowing from the western hills past the city before disappearing in the eastern gardens of the oasis. South of the wadi is a spring, <span>Efqa</span>. Pliny the Elder described the town in the 70s AD as famous for its desert location, the richness of its soil, and the springs surrounding it, which made agriculture and herding possible.</p>\n\n","Ptuj":"<p id=\"mwiw\">The <span>parish church</span> in the settlement is dedicated to <span>Saint George</span> and belongs to the <span>Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Maribor</span>.

and <span>Valais</span> have been popular tourist destinations since the 19th century. The <span>Jungfrau</span> was first climbed in 1811 and the <span>Finsteraarhorn</span> in 1812. The first tourists came mostly in summer, but in the 1930s winter sports became also popular. On the north side visitors are only able to visit the site via the Jungfrau railway which leads to the <span>Jungfraujoch</span>. The railway has turned the site from an inaccessible mountain face to a very accessible site visited by large nearby populations. The <span>Jungfrau railway</span> was built between 1870 and 1912, taking visitors from <span>Kleine Scheidegg</span> (2,061<span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" id=\"mwiA\">&nbsp;</span>m) to Jungfraujoch (3,454<span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" id=\"mwiQ\">&nbsp;</span>m), the saddle between the <span>Mönch</span> and Jungfrau. On the south side the area of <span>Riederalp</span>-<span>Bettmeralp</span> hosts most of the visitors. Other inhabited regions on the margin are <span>Kandersteg</span> and the <span>Lötschental</span>. The network of foot-paths is well developed around the site but nonexistent through it, the centre being inaccessible to walkers. The site can only be accessed by experienced mountaineers and there is a series of 37 shelters and five mountain refuges with a total of 1,582 beds, managed by the <span>Swiss Alpine Club</span>. The Aletsch ecological centre in Riederalp is run by Pro Natura functions as a visitor center.</p>\n<p id=\"mwUg\">Glaciers and barren rock constitute 80% of the area; 6% is forested, 5.2% is alpine meadow, and 8% is scrub. Altitude is the strongest factor influencing the distribution and diversity of the vegetation. Within the nominated area there are 1,800 species of <span>vascular plants</span> and 700 <span>mosses</span>. The growing period decreases with altitude, but there are 529 species of <span>phanerogams</span> and <span>pteridophytes</span> above the <span>tree line</span>.\n<span>Broadleaf</span> montane forest extends from 900<span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" id=\"mwWQ\">&nbsp;</span>m to 1,300<span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" id=\"mwWg\">&nbsp;</span>m on north- facing slopes. On south-facing slopes the same zone is approximately 200<span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" id=\"mwWw\">&nbsp;</span>m higher. The <span>subalpine zone</span> lies between 1,300<span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" id=\"mwXQ\">&nbsp;</span>m to 2,000<span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" id=\"mwXg\">&nbsp;</span>m, between the broadleaf and alpine zone. Characteristic species are the <span>Swiss Pine</span> (<i id=\"mwYA\">Pinus Cembra</i>) and the <span>Norway Spruce</span> (<i id=\"mwYg\">Picea abies</i>) on the north and south side respectively. An example of Pinus cembra forest is the Aletsch Forest above the <span>Aletsch Glacier</span> and near the tree line. It developed on the moraine of the glacier after its maximum extension in 1850. The zone directly above the tree line forms a girdle of moorland vegetation and Alpine grassland.</p>\n\n\n\n","Dushanbe":"<p id=\"mwKQ\">Situated at the confluence of two rivers, <span>Varzob</span> and <span>Kofarnihon</span>, Dushanbe is the capital of Tajikistan. Although archaeological remnants dating to the 5th century BC have been discovered in the area, there is little to suggest that Dushanbe was more than a small village until the early 20th century.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mwAQo\"><span>Tajik Air</span> had its head office on the grounds of <span>Dushanbe Airport</span> in Dushanbe. <span>Somon Air</span> has its head office in Dushanbe.</p>\n\n","Stockholm archipelago":"<p id=\"mwYQ\">Many poets, authors and artists have been influenced and fascinated by the Stockholm archipelago. Among them are <span>August Strindberg</span>, <span>Ture Nerman</span>, <span>Roland Svensson</span>, <span>Ernst Didring</span> and <span>Aleister Crowley</span>. <span>Björn Ulvaeus</span> and <span>Benny Andersson</span> from the group <span>ABBA</span> wrote most of their songs in a cabin located on the archipelago.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mwIA\">The archipelago extends from <span>Stockholm</span> roughly <span about=\"#mwt42\" typeof=\"mw:Transclusion\" data-mw=\"{&quot;parts&quot;:[{&quot;template&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;convert&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;./Template:Convert&quot;},&quot;params&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;60&quot;},&quot;2&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;km&quot;},&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;mi&quot;},&quot;4&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;0&quot;},&quot;abbr&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;off&quot;}},&quot;i&quot;:0}}]}\" id=\"mwIg\">60 kilometres (37 miles)</span> to the east.

Many major corporations have large branch offices in Kandy and many industries including textiles, Sri Lankan gemstones, furniture, information technology and jewellery are found there. Many agriculture research centers are located throughout the city.</p>","Cradle of Humankind":"<p id=\"mwUQ\">In 1935, Robert Broom found the first ape-man fossils at Sterkfontein and began work at this site. \nIn 1938, a young schoolboy, Gert Terrblanche, brought Raymond Dart fragments of a skull from nearby <span>Kromdraai</span> which later were identified as <i id=\"mwUw\"><span>Paranthropus robustus</span></i>. Also in 1938, a single ape-man tooth was found at the <span>Cooper's</span> site between Kromdraai and Sterkfontein. In 1948, the Camp-Peabody Expedition from the United States worked at Bolts Farm and <span>Gladysvale</span> looking for fossil hominids but failed to find any. Later in 1948, Robert Broom identified the first hominid remains from Swartkrans cave. In 1954, <span>C.K. Brain</span> began working at sites in the Cradle, including Cooper's Cave. He then initiated his three-decade work at Swartkrans cave, which resulted in the recovery of the second-largest sample of hominid remains from the Cradle. The oldest controlled use of fire by Homo erectus was also discovered at Swartkrans and dated to over 1 million years ago.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n","Khao Yai National Park":"<p id=\"mwNg\">Around 1922 some people from Ban Tha Dan and Ban Tha Chai villages in <span>Nakhon Nayok Province</span> built a settlement within the forest in the Sankamphaeng mountains. Up to 30 households cultivated the land.

The park lies in northwestern Tanzania, bordered to the north by the <span>Kenyan</span> border, where it is continuous with the <span>Maasai Mara National Reserve</span>. To the southeast of the park is the <span>Ngorongoro Conservation Area</span>, to the southwest lies Maswa Game Reserve, to the west are the <span>Ikorongo</span> and <span>Grumeti Game Reserves</span>, and to the northeast and east lies the Loliondo Game Control Area. Together, these areas form the larger <span>Serengeti ecosystem</span>.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul id=\"mwZg\"><li id=\"mwZw\">Serengeti plains: the almost treeless grassland of the south is the most emblematic scenery of the park. This is where the wildebeest breed, as they remain in the plains from December to May. Other hoofed animals - zebra, gazelle, impala, <span>hartebeest</span>, <span>topi</span>, buffalo, <span>waterbuck</span> - also occur in huge numbers during the wet season. \"Kopjes\" are granite florations that are very common in the region, and they are great observation posts for predators, as well as a refuge for <span>hyrax</span> and <span>pythons</span>.</li></ul>\n\n<ul id=\"mwcQ\"><li id=\"mwcg\">Western corridor: the black clay soil covers the savannah of this region. The Grumeti River and its gallery forests is home to <span>Nile crocodiles</span>, <span>patas monkeys</span>, <span>hippopotamus</span>, and <span>martial eagles</span>. The migration passes through from May to July.</li></ul>\n\n<ul id=\"mwew\"><li id=\"mwfA\">Northern Serengeti: the landscape is dominated by open woodlands (predominantly <span>Commiphora</span>) and hills, ranging from <span>Seronera</span> in the south to the Mara River on the Kenyan border. Apart from the migratory wildebeest and zebra (which occur from July to August, and in November), this is the best place to find <span>elephant</span>, <span>giraffe</span>, and <span>dik dik</span>.</li></ul>\n\n\n<p id=\"mwHw\">The <span>Maasai people</span> had been grazing their livestock in the open plains of eastern <span>Mara Region</span>, which they named \"endless plains,\" for around 200 years when the first European explorer, Austrian <span>Oscar Baumann</span>, visited the area in 1892. The name \"Serengeti\" is an approximation of the word used by the Maasai to describe the area, <i id=\"mwJQ\">siringet</i>, which means \"the place where the land runs on forever\".</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Robben Island":"<p id=\"mwNQ\">In 1654 the settlers of the <span>Dutch Cape Colony</span> placed all their ewes and a few rams on Robben Island, the men built a large shed and a shelter.

Ayutthaya became the second Siamese capital after <span>Sukhothai</span>. It is estimated that Ayutthaya by the year 1600 had a population of about 300,000, with the population perhaps reaching 1,000,000 around 1700, making it one of the world's largest cities at that time, when it was sometimes known as the \"<span>Venice of the East</span>\".</p>\n\n","Kanchanaburi":"<p id=\"mwGw\">In the late-18th century, Kanchanaburi was established by King <span>Rama I</span> as a defensive outpost against possible Burmese attacks in what is now Lat Ya Sub-district.

The word ‘Chiang’ means ‘city’ in <span>Thai</span>, so Chiang Rai would mean ‘the City of (Mang) <span>Rai</span>’. Subsequently, Chiang Rai was conquered by <span>Burma</span> and remained under Burmese rule for several hundred years. It was not until 1786 that Chiang Rai became a <span>Chiang Mai</span> vassal.

This was the location of the first Dutch settlement, a trading post established by Nicolaes Baliestel and Dirck Claeszoon van Sanen in 1613.

Although a historic port used by the native Jaffna kingdom was already in existence when the Portuguese arrived, it was the European mercantile activity that made it prominent. In colonial times, production of clothes, items of gold and silver, processing of tobacco, rice and other related activities formed an important part of the economic activities. In modern times, the port was its principal source of revenue but it has declined drastically. Currently it survives as a fishing port. The city had a wide range of industries, including food processing, packaging, making of household items, and salt processing, but most ceased after 1995. Since then, most industrialists, entrepreneurs, and business people have relocated to the rest of Sri Lanka and abroad. After 2009, foreign governments within the EU, US, India, and investors from the south of the island and the Sri Lankan Tamil diaspora have shown an interest in making investments in Jaffna district in general and Jaffna city in particular. Shopping malls such as the <span>Cargills Square</span> and hotels such as Jetwing Jaffna, <span>Tilko Jaffna City Hotel</span> have been built boosting the tourism industry in the city.</p>\n\n","Gwangju":"<p id=\"mwMw\">The city was established in 57 BC.

The Alhambra is the architectural culmination of the works of Nasrid art that were undertaken in the 13th and 14th centuries, with most of the Alhambra having been built at the time of <span>Yusuf I</span> and <span>Mohammed V</span>, between 1333 and 1354.</p>\n\n\n\n","Dar es Salaam":"<p id=\"mwcg\">Dar es Salaam is located at 6°48'<span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" id=\"mwcw\">&nbsp;</span>South, 39°17'<span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" id=\"mwdA\">&nbsp;</span>East (−6.8000, 39.2833), on a natural harbour on the eastern coast of East Africa, with sandy beaches in some areas.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mwMA\">In the 19th century, <b id=\"mwMQ\">Mzizima</b> (<span>Swahili</span> for \"healthy town\") was a coastal fishing <span>village</span> on the periphery of <span>Indian Ocean trade</span> routes. In 1865 or 1866, Sultan <span>Majid bin Said of Zanzibar</span> began building a new city very close to Mzizima and named it <b id=\"mwPA\">Dar es Salaam</b>. The name is commonly translated as \"abode/home of peace\", based on the Arabic <i id=\"mwPQ\">dar</i> (\"house\"), and the Arabic <i id=\"mwPg\">es salaam</i> (\"of peace\"). Dar es Salaam fell into decline after Majid's death in 1870, but was revived in 1887 when the <span>German East Africa Company</span> established a station there. The <span>town</span>'s growth was facilitated by its role as the administrative and commercial centre of <span>German East Africa</span> and industrial expansion resulting from the construction of the <span>Central Railway Line</span> in the early 1900s.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Zaragoza":"<p id=\"mwAUI\">Christianity took root in Zaragoza at an early date.

The port's imported cargo include clothing, construction materials, vehicles, furniture, minerals, tobacco, cotton, and food supplies such as lintels, onions, wheat, barley, dates, grains and figs, and in 2008, the port handled about 8 million tons of cargo.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Aral Sea":"<p id=\"mwZg\">Most of the area around the Aral Sea was inhabited by desert nomads who left few written records. However, the Oxus delta to the south has a long history under the name of <span>Khwarezm</span>. It was once the westernmost border of <span>Tang dynasty</span> <span>China</span>.</p>\n\n\n<p id=\"mwAR0\">The Aral Sea is considered an example of <span>ecosystem collapse</span>. The <span>ecosystems</span> of the Aral Sea and the <span>river deltas</span> feeding into it have been nearly destroyed, not least because of the much higher salinity. The receding sea has left huge plains covered with salt and toxic chemicals resulting from <span>weapons testing</span>, industrial projects, and pesticides and fertilizer runoff.  Due to the shrinking water source and subsequent worsening water and soil quality, pesticides were increasingly used starting in the 1960s to increase cotton yields, which further polluted the water with toxins such as DDTs. Furthermore, “PCB-compounds and heavy metals” from industrial pollution contaminated both water and soil. Due to the minimal amount of water left in the Aral sea, concentrations of these pollutants have increased drastically in both the water and soil. These substances form wind-borne toxic dust that spreads throughout the region. People living near the Aral Sea come in contact with pollutants through drinking water and inhalation of contaminated dust. Furthermore, due to the presence in drinking water, the toxins have entered the food chain. As a result, the land around the Aral Sea is heavily polluted, and the people living in the area are suffering from a lack of fresh water and <span>health problems</span>, including high rates of certain forms of cancer and lung diseases. Respiratory illnesses, including <span>tuberculosis</span> (most of which is <span>drug resistant</span>) and cancer, digestive disorders, <span>anaemia</span>, and infectious diseases are common ailments in the region. Liver, kidney, and eye problems can also be attributed to the toxic dust storms. All of this has resulted in an unusually high fatality rate among vulnerable parts of the population: the child mortality rate is 75 in every 1,000 newborns, and maternity death is 12 in every 1,000 women.</p> \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"gallery mw-gallery-packed center\" typeof=\"mw:Extension/gallery\" about=\"#mwt342\" data-mw=\"{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;gallery&quot;,&quot;attrs&quot;:{&quot;class&quot;:&quot;center&quot;,&quot;mode&quot;:&quot;packed&quot;,&quot;heights&quot;:&quot;160px&quot;},&quot;body&quot;:{&quot;extsrc&quot;:&quot;\\nFile:AralSeaModis.jpg|Aral Sea dust storm, March 2010\\nFile:Aralship2.jpg|Abandoned ship near Aral, Kazakhstan\\nFile:AralskHarbor.jpg|A former harbour in the city of Aral\\nFile:Kazakh fisherman Aralsk.jpg|Local Kazakh fisherman harvesting the day's catch\\n&quot;}}\" id=\"mwAVE\">\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 215.33333333333px;\" id=\"mwAVI\"><div class=\"thumb\" style=\"width: 213.33333333333px;\" id=\"mwAVM\"><figure-inline typeof=\"mw:Image\" id=\"mwAVQ\"><a href=\"./File:AralSeaModis.jpg\" id=\"mwAVU\"><img resource=\"./File:AralSeaModis.jpg\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/AralSeaModis.jpg/320px-AralSeaModis.jpg\" data-file-width=\"2400\" data-file-height=\"1800\" data-file-type=\"bitmap\" height=\"160\" width=\"214\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/AralSeaModis.jpg/640px-AralSeaModis.jpg 2x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/AralSeaModis.jpg/480px-AralSeaModis.jpg 1.5x\" id=\"mwAVY\"></a></figure-inline></div><div class=\"gallerytext\" id=\"mwAVc\">Aral Sea dust storm, March 2010</div></li>\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 215.33333333333px;\" id=\"mwAVg\"><div class=\"thumb\" style=\"width: 213.33333333333px;\" id=\"mwAVk\"><figure-inline typeof=\"mw:Image\" id=\"mwAVo\"><a href=\"./File:Aralship2.jpg\" id=\"mwAVs\"><img resource=\"./File:Aralship2.jpg\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Aralship2.jpg/320px-Aralship2.jpg\" data-file-width=\"1600\" data-file-height=\"1200\" data-file-type=\"bitmap\" height=\"160\" width=\"214\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Aralship2.jpg/640px-Aralship2.jpg 2x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Aralship2.jpg/480px-Aralship2.jpg 1.5x\" id=\"mwAVw\"></a></figure-inline></div><div class=\"gallerytext\" id=\"mwAV0\">Abandoned ship near Aral, Kazakhstan</div></li>\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 234px;\" id=\"mwAV4\"><div class=\"thumb\" style=\"width: 232px;\" id=\"mwAV8\"><figure-inline typeof=\"mw:Image\" id=\"mwAWA\"><a href=\"./File:AralskHarbor.jpg\" id=\"mwAWE\"><img resource=\"./File:AralskHarbor.jpg\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/AralskHarbor.jpg/348px-AralskHarbor.jpg\" data-file-width=\"1455\" data-file-height=\"1005\" data-file-type=\"bitmap\" height=\"160\" width=\"232\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/AralskHarbor.jpg/695px-AralskHarbor.jpg 2x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/AralskHarbor.jpg/521px-AralskHarbor.jpg 1.5x\" id=\"mwAWI\"></a></figure-inline></div><div class=\"gallerytext\" id=\"mwAWM\">A former harbour in the city of Aral</div></li>\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 108px;\" id=\"mwAWQ\"><div class=\"thumb\" style=\"width: 106px;\" id=\"mwAWU\"><figure-inline typeof=\"mw:Image\" id=\"mwAWY\"><a href=\"./File:Kazakh_fisherman_Aralsk.jpg\" id=\"mwAWc\"><img resource=\"./File:Kazakh_fisherman_Aralsk.jpg\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Kazakh_fisherman_Aralsk.jpg/159px-Kazakh_fisherman_Aralsk.jpg\" data-file-width=\"2848\" data-file-height=\"4288\" data-file-type=\"bitmap\" height=\"160\" width=\"106\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Kazakh_fisherman_Aralsk.jpg/319px-Kazakh_fisherman_Aralsk.jpg 2x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Kazakh_fisherman_Aralsk.jpg/239px-Kazakh_fisherman_Aralsk.jpg 1.5x\" id=\"mwAWg\"></a></figure-inline></div><div class=\"gallerytext\" id=\"mwAWk\">Local Kazakh fisherman harvesting the day's catch</div></li>\n</ul>\n\n","Basel":"<p id=\"mwBLU\">The city of Basel, located in the heart of the tri-border region (called <i id=\"mwBLY\">Dreiländereck</i>) is one of the most dynamic economic regions of Switzerland.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Málaga":"<p id=\"mwAW0\">The old historic centre of Málaga reaches the harbour to the south.

The region itself is coextensive with the city and is much smaller than the historical province of <span>Benadir</span>.

Features of the city include the Hamarwein old town, the <span>Bakaara Market</span>, and <span>Gezira Beach</span>. The sandy beaches of Mogadishu have vibrant coral reefs, and are prime real estate for the first tourist resorts in many years.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mwAvc\">Mogadishu traditionally served as a commercial and financial centre. Before the importation of mass-produced cloth from Europe and America, the city's textiles were forwarded far and wide throughout the interior of the continent, as well as to the Arabian peninsula and as far as the <span>Persian coast</span>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Geneva":"<p id=\"mwlw\">Geneva was an <span>Allobrogian</span> border town, fortified against the <span>Helvetii</span> tribe, when the Romans took it in 121 BC.

The city has an important and long-established <span>finance sector</span>, which specialises in <span>private banking</span>, managing assets of about US$1 trillion, and the financing of international trade. In the September 2017 <span>Global Financial Centres Index</span>, Geneva was ranked as being the 15th most competitive financial centre in the world (up from 20th in March 2017) and the fifth most competitive in Europe (after <span>London</span>, <span>Zürich</span>, <span>Frankfurt</span>, and <span>Luxembourg</span>).</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Gyeongju":"<p id=\"mw-A\">Gyeongju lies in the southeastern corner of North Gyeongsang Province, and is bounded by the metropolitan city of <span>Ulsan</span> on the south.

Gyeongju first enters non-Korean records as <span>Saro-guk</span>, during the <span>Samhan</span> period in the early <span>Common Era</span>. Korean records, probably based on the dynastic chronicles of Silla, record that Saro-guk was established in 57 BCE, when six small villages in the Gyeongju area united under <span>Bak Hyeokgeose</span>. As the kingdom expanded, it changed its name to Silla. During the Silla period, the city was called \"Seorabeol\" (lit. Capital), \"Gyerim\" (lit. Rooster's forest) or \"Geumseong\" (lit.

The bell signaled the different times of the day and controlled the four major gates to the city. North of downtown is <span>Bukhan Mountain</span>, and to the south is the smaller <span>Namsan</span>. Further south are the old suburbs, <span>Yongsan District</span> and <span>Mapo District</span>. Across the Han River are the newer and wealthier areas of <span>Gangnam District</span>, <span>Seocho District</span> and surrounding neighborhoods.</p>\n\n\n<p id=\"mwATo\">Seoul is in the northwest of <span>South Korea</span>.

The Han River and its surrounding area played an important role in Korean history. The <span>Three Kingdoms of Korea</span> strove to take control of this land, where the river was used as a trade route to China (via the <span>Yellow Sea</span>). The river is no longer actively used for navigation, because its <span>estuary</span> is located at the borders of the two Koreas, with civilian entry barred. Historically, the city was during the <span>Joseon</span> dynasty bounded by the <span>Seoul Fortress Wall</span>, which stretched between the four main mountains in central Seoul: <span>Namsan</span>, <span>Naksan</span>, <span>Bukhansan</span> and <span>Inwangsan</span>. The city is bordered by eight mountains, as well as the more level lands of the Han River plain and western areas. Due to its geography and to economic development policies, Seoul is a very polycentric city. The area that was the old capital in the Joseon dynasty, and mostly comprises <span>Jongno District</span> and <span>Jung District</span>, constitutes the historical and political center of the city. However, for example, the city's financial capital is widely considered to be in <span>Yeouido</span>, while its economic capital is <span>Gangnam District</span>.</p>\n\n\n","Barcelona":"<p id=\"mwBAE\">Barcelona's cultural roots go back 2000 years. Since the <span>arrival of democracy</span>, the Catalan language (very much repressed during the <span>dictatorship of Franco</span>) has been promoted, both by recovering works from the past and by stimulating the creation of new works. Barcelona is designated as a <span>world-class city</span> by the Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network. It has also been part of the <span>UNESCO Creative Cities Network</span> as a City of Literature since 2015.</p>\n\n\n<p id=\"mwBhU\">The <i id=\"mwBhY\"><span>Barri Gòtic</span></i> (Catalan for \"Gothic Quarter\") is the centre of the old city of Barcelona.

Several of these buildings are <span>World Heritage Sites</span>. Especially remarkable is the work of architect <span>Antoni Gaudí</span>, which can be seen throughout the city.

It was originally built by the <span>Dutch</span> during their brief period of colonisation of the island.  It was close to their landing port, had ample water supply from many rivers and streams and had a scenic view of the large bay area.  Mahébourg knew major development around 1806 during the French colonisation era.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n","Prespa (North Macedonia)":"<p id=\"mwFw\">In today's borders, the region is divided between three countries, which is result of the division of the Ottoman territories of Europe after the two <span>Balkan Wars</span>. Prespa itself has an important <span>geostrategic</span> position. During the Roman rule through Prespa, the famous ancient Roman road \"<span>Via Egnatia</span>\" was built. In addition to road, several settlements were also built. In the 6th and 7th centuries in Prespa didn't settle permanently Slavic tribes.

The tourist resort of <span>Vrátna dolina</span> belongs to the village.</p>\n<p id=\"mwHg\">The village was established in 1580, but the area was inhabited even before its establishment. Originally a <span>Vlach</span> settlement from the period of Vlach colonization, it slowly began to change to an agricultural settlement, as many new settlers in the 17th century came to the village.

It is bounded on the north by <span>Burias</span> and <span>Ticao Pass</span>, east by <span>San Bernardino Strait</span>, south by the <span>Visayan Sea</span>, and west by the <span>Sibuyan Sea</span>.

Archaeological records show that Batungan (in Mandaon) and Bagumbayan (in Palanas) were major settlement sites during the Bronze Age (4000-1000 BC). The development of bronze metallurgy in South-East Asia coincided with an increasingly hierarchical society, firmly based on agricultural village settlements. It was these crucial changes, the introduction of new technologies, new social forms, and a new economic base, which culminated in the foundation of the proto-urban settlements of the 1st millennium AD. A fine stone chisel from Mount Batungan is dated to the twelfth century BC. Of the age of Philippine neoliths it is only possible to say that polished stone adzes from Masbate have been dated from 2710 BC to AD 179.2 Kalanay (in Aroroy) was an island site from 1000 BC-AD 850 (early metal). Masbateño burial jars and a small pottery skull box found in caves dated to the beginning of the Christian era. Exquisite goldwork represents an old Philippine wealth in both an economic and an artistic sense: all sorts of wrought or molded ornaments and jewelry demonstrate both the availability of the raw material and the skill of the artisan – finger rings, earrings, head-bands, pendants and pectoral ornaments, heavy chains with interlocking serrated edges, light filigree work, delicate necklaces of fine twisted wires, 12-millimeter beads composed of 184 separate granules soldered together, thin hammered sheets for decorating grosser objects like earplugs or the visages of corpses, and a charming little snail of unknown use. Productive mines in Benguet, Butuan, Masbate, and Paracale were in operation and gold being panned in riverbeds all over the archipelago when the Spaniards arrived.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Camiguin":"<p id=\"mwdw\">The province consists primarily of Camiguin Island, as well as a few other surrounding minor islets including:</p>\n<ul id=\"mweA\"><li id=\"mweQ\"><span>White Island</span>, about <span about=\"#mwt78\" typeof=\"mw:Transclusion\" data-mw=\"{&quot;parts&quot;:[{&quot;template&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;convert&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;./Template:Convert&quot;},&quot;params&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;5&quot;},&quot;2&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;km&quot;}},&quot;i&quot;:0}}]}\" id=\"mwew\">5 kilometres (3.1</span><span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" about=\"#mwt78\">&nbsp;</span><span about=\"#mwt78\">mi)</span> west of the town of <span>Mambajao</span></li>\n<li id=\"mwfQ\"><span>Mantigue Island</span>, about <span about=\"#mwt79\" typeof=\"mw:Transclusion\" data-mw=\"{&quot;parts&quot;:[{&quot;template&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;convert&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;./Template:Convert&quot;},&quot;params&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;14&quot;},&quot;2&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;km&quot;}},&quot;i&quot;:0}}]}\" id=\"mwfw\">14 kilometres (8.7</span><span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" about=\"#mwt79\">&nbsp;</span><span about=\"#mwt79\">mi)</span> south of Mambajao.</li></ul>\n\n\n<p id=\"mw1A\">The economy is based upon fishing and farming, with <span>copra</span> providing the greatest income contribution. <span>Lanzones</span> has since then became the main agricultural product of the island province.

The old city consists of several historic areas. These are: Cetate (Belváros in Hungarian, Innere Stadt in German), Iosefin (Józsefváros, Josephstadt), Elisabetin (Erzsébetváros, Elisabethstadt), Fabric (Gyárváros, Fabrikstadt). Numerous bars, clubs and restaurants have opened in the old <span>Baroque</span> square (Unirii Square).</p>\n\n\n<p id=\"mwAR8\">Timișoara lies at an altitude of <span about=\"#mwt318\" typeof=\"mw:Transclusion\" data-mw=\"{&quot;parts&quot;:[{&quot;template&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;convert&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;./Template:Convert&quot;},&quot;params&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;90&quot;},&quot;2&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;m&quot;},&quot;abbr&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;off&quot;}},&quot;i&quot;:0}}]}\" id=\"mwASA\">90 metres (300 feet)</span> on the southeast edge of the <span>Banat</span> plain, part of the <span>Pannonian Plain</span> near the divergence of the <span>Timiș</span> and <span>Bega</span> rivers. The waters of the two rivers form a swampy and frequently flooded land. Timișoara developed on one of few places where the swamps could be crossed. These constituted a natural protection around the fortress for a very long time, however, they also favoured a wet and insalubrious climate, as well as the proliferation of the plague and cholera, which kept the number of inhabitants at a relatively low number and significantly prevented the development of the city. With time, however, the rivers of the area were drained, dammed and diverted. Due to these hydrographical projects undertaken in the 18th century, the city no longer lies on the river <span>Timiș</span>, but on the <span>Bega Canal</span>. This improvement of the land was made irreversible by building the Bega Canal (started in 1728) and by the complete draining of the surrounding marshes. However, the land across the city lies above a water table at a depth of only <span about=\"#mwt319\" typeof=\"mw:Transclusion\" data-mw=\"{&quot;parts&quot;:[{&quot;template&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;convert&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;./Template:Convert&quot;},&quot;params&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;0.5&quot;},&quot;2&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;to(-)&quot;},&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;5&quot;},&quot;4&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;m&quot;},&quot;5&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;ft&quot;},&quot;6&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},&quot;abbr&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;off&quot;}},&quot;i&quot;:0}}]}\" id=\"mwASc\">0.5</span><span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" about=\"#mwt319\">&nbsp;</span><span about=\"#mwt319\">to 5 metres (1.6–16.4 feet)</span>, a factor which does not allow the construction of tall buildings.

Because of the growth in this industry, the city has sometimes been called the \"Polish <span>Manchester</span>\" and the \"<span>lingerie</span> capital of Poland\". As a result, Łódź grew from a population of 13,000 in 1840 to over 500,000 in 1913. By the time right before World War I Łódź had become one of the most densely populated industrial cities in the world, with 13,280 inhabitants per km, and also one of the most polluted. The textile industry declined dramatically in 1990 and 1991, and no major textile company survives in Łódź today. However, countless small companies still provide a significant output of textiles, mostly for export to Russia and other countries of the <span>former Soviet Union</span>. Łódź is no longer a significant industrial centre, but it has become a major hub for the business services sector in Poland owing to the availability of highly-skilled workers and active cooperation between local universities and the business sector.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Zion National Park":"<p id=\"mwVw\">The park is located in southwestern <span>Utah</span> in <span>Washington</span>, <span>Iron</span> and <span>Kane</span> counties.

Due to its position at the center of Yunnan, one of China's largest producers of agricultural products, minerals and <span>hydroelectricity</span>, Kunming is the main commercial hub for most of the province's resources.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Quezon City":"<p id=\"mw1g\">The city lies on the Guadalupe Plateau, a relatively high plateau at the northeast of the metropolis situated between the lowlands of <span>Manila</span> to the southwest and the <span>Marikina River</span> Valley to the east. The southern portion is drained by the narrow <span>San Juan River</span> and its tributaries to <span>Pasig River</span>, while running in the northern portions of the city is the equally-narrow <span>Tullahan River</span>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mwTw\">Before Quezon City was created, its land was settled by the small individual towns of <span>San Francisco del Monte</span>, <span>Novaliches</span>, and Balintawak.

The tableau of Goa showcases religious harmony by focusing on the Deepastambha, the Cross and Ghode Modni followed by a chariot. Western royal attire of kings is as much part of Goa's cultural heritage as are regional dances performed depicting a unique blend of different religions and cultures of this State. Prominent local festivals are <span>Christmas</span>, <span>Easter</span>, <span>Carnival</span>, <span>Diwali</span>, <span>Shigmo</span>, <span>Chavoth</span>, <span>Samvatsar Padvo</span>, <span>Dasara</span> etc. The Goan Carnival and Christmas-new year celebrations are well known to attract a large number of tourists.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mwAmE\">Tourism is generally focused on the coastal areas of Goa, with decreased tourist activity inland.

The state was hopeful that changes could be made which would attract a more upscale demographic.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Poole":"<p id=\"mwBFA\">The '<span>Beating of the bounds</span>' is an ancient annual custom first carried out in 1612, which revives the traditional checking of the sea boundaries awarded to Poole by the <span>Cinque Port</span> of <span>Winchelsea</span> in 1364. The Admiral of the Port of Poole (the mayor) and other dignitaries, and members of the public sail from the mouth of the <span>River Frome</span> to <span>Old Harry Rocks</span> to confirm the Mayor's authority over the water boundaries of the harbour and check for any encroachments. As there are no physical landmarks that can be beaten at sea, traditionally children from Poole were encouraged to remember the bounds of their town by taking part in the 'Pins and Points' ceremony involving the beating of a boy and pricking of a girl's hand with a needle. In modern times, the acts have been symbolically carried out.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mwAz4\">Poole <span>Quay</span> is a visitor attraction to the south of the town centre lined with a mixture of traditional public houses, new bars, redeveloped warehouses, modern apartment blocks and historic <span>listed buildings</span>. Once the busy centre of Poole's <span>maritime industry</span>, all port activities moved to <span>Hamworthy</span> in the 1970s as the Quay became increasingly popular with tourists. The Grade II* listed <span>Customs House</span> on the quay-front was built in 1814 and now functions as a restaurant and bar. Nearby the Grade I listed Town Cellars, a <span>medieval</span> warehouse built in the 15th century on the foundations of a 14th-century stone building, houses a <span>local history</span> centre. <span>Scaplen's Court</span>, another Grade I listed building, also dates from the medieval era. <span>Poole Pottery</span> has been redeveloped into an <span>apartment block</span>. Boats regularly depart from the quay during the summer and provide cruises around the harbour and to <span>Brownsea Island</span>, the <span>River Frome</span> and <span>Swanage</span>. Public artworks along the Quay include <i id=\"mwA1Y\">Sea Music</i> – a large metal sculpture designed by <span>Sir Anthony Caro</span>, and a life-size bronze sculpture of <span>Robert Baden-Powell</span> created to celebrate the founding of the <span>Scout Movement</span> on Brownsea Island. At the western end of the quay near the mouth of Holes Bay is <span>Poole Bridge</span>. Built in 1927, it is the third bridge to be located on the site since 1834.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","La Paz":"<p id=\"mwAuE\">La Paz is an important cultural center of Bolivia. The city hosts several cathedrals belonging to the colonial times, such as the San Francisco Cathedral and the Metropolitan Cathedral, this last one located on Murillo Square, which is also home of the political and administrative power of the country. Hundreds of different museums can be found across the city, the most notable ones on Jaén Street, which street design has been preserved from the Spanish days and is home of 10 different museums.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mwAhI\">The city of La Paz has a consistently decreasing volume of colonial buildings, mostly centered around the vicinity of the Plaza Murillo. Due to a lack of funds and the inability of property owners to pay for restorations to colonial buildings, many have been torn down, or are in a dilapidated state. As historic buildings are more expensive to keep, land owners find it less of a burden to construct more modern buildings as opposed to keeping the old ones. Although there has been an increasing number of projects and propositions to restore some of the city's colonial buildings, the future of these historic edifices remains uncertain.</p>","Mashhad":"<p id=\"mw6g\">The city is located at 36.20º North latitude and 59.35º East longitude, in the valley of the <span>Kashafrud River</span> near <span>Turkmenistan</span>, between the two mountain ranges of <span>Binalood</span> and <span>Hezar Masjed Mountains</span>.

Traditional Chinese values emphasising family and education blend with Western ideals, including economic liberty and the rule of law. Although the vast majority of the population is ethnically Chinese, Hong Kong has developed a distinct identity. The territory diverged from the mainland due to its long period of colonial administration and a different pace of economic, social, and cultural development. Mainstream culture is derived from immigrants originating from various parts of China. This was influenced by British-style education, a separate political system, and the territory's rapid development during the late 20th century. Most migrants of that era fled poverty and war, reflected in the prevailing attitude toward wealth; Hongkongers tend to link self-image and decision-making to material benefits. Residents' sense of local identity has markedly increased post-handover: 53 per cent of the population identify as \"Hongkongers\", while 11 per cent describe themselves as \"Chinese\".

The district commissioner's office was built, followed by a small medical clinic and a government prison. Police headquarters were built in <span>Lokitaung</span>, as tribal disputes were common in the area. During the 1960s, missionaries built schools in and around the town. Shah Mohamed opened several stores in the remote towns of this Turkana county because he was the only contractor and supplier to government departments, carried mail to the area, and supplied and transported goods for the Norwegian and Italian fish-canning projects on Lake Turkana (both of which eventually failed).</p>\n\n","Grenå":"<p id=\"mwEg\">Grenaa was first mentioned in 1231.

Just to the north is the <span>Kisere Forest Reserve</span>. Throughout the forest are a series of grassy glades, ranging in size from about 1 to 50, with a few larger clearings. The origins of the glades are uncertain. Some are certainly recent clearings, but others predate recent records. These may have originated from past human activity such as cattle grazing or may be the result of herbivory and movements by large mammals such as buffalo and elephants (both now extirpated from the region). The glades vary a great deal in structure, some being open grass and others having a considerable number of trees or shrubs. A number of streams and small creeks run through the reserve. The larger creeks are usually bordered by a few to tens of meters of forest on either side which divide the glades, while the smallest creeks flow through open grasslands, often forming small marshy patches.</p>","Juan Fernández Islands":"<p id=\"mwSQ\">Alejandro Selkirk is the largest of the Juan Fernández Islands at <span about=\"#mwt58\" typeof=\"mw:Transclusion\" data-mw=\"{&quot;parts&quot;:[{&quot;template&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;convert&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;./Template:Convert&quot;},&quot;params&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;49.5&quot;},&quot;2&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;km²&quot;},&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},&quot;abbr&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;on&quot;}},&quot;i&quot;:0}}]}\" id=\"mwSg\">49.5</span><span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" about=\"#mwt58\">&nbsp;</span><span about=\"#mwt58\">km</span><span about=\"#mwt58\"> (19.1</span><span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" about=\"#mwt58\">&nbsp;</span><span about=\"#mwt58\">sq</span><span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" about=\"#mwt58\">&nbsp;</span><span about=\"#mwt58\">mi)</span>, and its highest peak, <span>Cerro de Los Inocentes</span>, is also the highest point of the archipelago at <span about=\"#mwt59\" typeof=\"mw:Transclusion\" data-mw=\"{&quot;parts&quot;:[{&quot;template&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;convert&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;./Template:Convert&quot;},&quot;params&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;1268&quot;},&quot;2&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;m&quot;},&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;ft&quot;},&quot;4&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;0&quot;},&quot;abbr&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;on&quot;}},&quot;i&quot;:0}}]}\" id=\"mwTA\">1,268</span><span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" about=\"#mwt59\">&nbsp;</span><span about=\"#mwt59\">m (4,160</span><span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" about=\"#mwt59\">&nbsp;</span><span about=\"#mwt59\">ft)</span>.

It is the <span>largest county</span> in Ireland by land area, and the largest of Munster's six counties by population and area. At the last census in 2016, Cork city stood at 125,657. The population of the entire county is 542,868 making it the state's second-<span>most populous</span> county and the third-most populous county on the island of Ireland. The remit of Cork County Council includes some suburbs of the city not within the area of Cork City Council.</p>\n\n\n<p id=\"mw3w\">The county is colloquially referred to as \"The Rebel County\", although uniquely Cork does not have an official motto. This name has 15th Century origins, but from the 20th century the name has been more commonly attributed to the prominent role Cork played in the <span>Irish War of Independence</span> (1919–1921) when it was the scene of considerable fighting. In addition, it was an anti-treaty stronghold during the <span>Irish Civil War</span> (1922–23). Much of what is now county Cork was once part of the <span>Kingdom of <i id=\"mw4w\">Deas Mumhan</i></span> (South <span>Munster</span>), anglicised as <span>\"Desmond\"</span>, ruled by the <span>MacCarthy Mór dynasty</span>. After the <span>Norman Invasion</span> in the 12th century, the McCarthy clan were pushed westward into what is now West Cork and <span>County Kerry</span>. <span>Dunlough Castle</span>, standing just north of <span>Mizen Head</span>, is one of the oldest castles in Ireland (A.D. 1207). The north and east of Cork were taken by the <span>Hiberno-Norman</span> <span>FitzGerald dynasty</span>, who became the <span>Earls of Desmond</span>. Cork City was given an English Royal Charter in 1318 and for many centuries was an outpost for <span>Old English</span> culture. The Fitzgerald Desmond dynasty was destroyed in the <span>Desmond Rebellions</span> of 1569–1573 and 1579–83. Much of county Cork was devastated in the fighting, particularly in the <span>Second Desmond Rebellion</span>.

The influence of Islamic and Arab culture on its architecture, music, attire, cuisine and lifestyle are very prominent as well. Five times every day, Muslims are called to prayer from the <span>minarets</span> of mosques which are scattered around the country. Since 2006, the weekend has been Friday-Saturday, as a compromise between Friday's holiness to Muslims and the Western weekend of Saturday-Sunday.</p>\n<p id=\"mwJQ\">Umm Al Quwain holds significant archaeological interest, with major finds at both <span>Tell Abraq</span> and <span>Ed-Dur</span> pointing to significant <span>Ancient Near Eastern Cities</span>. <span>Arrowheads</span> and other polished <span>flint</span> tools have been unearthed in various sites across the UAE while pieces of <span>Ubaid Age</span> pottery have been unearthed along the shores of the emirate. All evidence obtained so far indicate that contact with <span>Mesopotamia</span> existed as early as the 5th millennium BC, as an indigenous <span>ceramic</span> industry, did not emerge until the 3rd century BC.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Niagara Falls (Ontario)":"<p id=\"mwAQQ\">Some cultural areas of Niagara Falls include Queen Street, Main and Ferry Streets, Stamford Centre and Chippawa Square.

It was occupied by <span>Israel</span> during the <span>Suez Crisis</span> of 1956 and restored to Egypt in 1957. A <span>United Nations</span> peacekeeping force was subsequently stationed there until the 1967 <span>Six-Day War</span> when it was recaptured by Israel.

The town of Mombasa is centred on Mombasa Island, but extends to the mainland. The island is separated from the mainland by two <span>creeks</span>, <span>Port Reitz</span> in the south and <span>Tudor Creek</span> in the north.</p>","Brasília":"<p id=\"mwAhA\">As a venue for political events, music performances and movie festivals, Brasília is a cosmopolitan city, with around 124 <span>embassies</span>, a wide range of restaurants and complete infrastructure ready to host any kind of event. Not surprisingly, the city stands out as an important business/tourism destination, which is an important part of the local economy, with dozens of hotels spread around the federal capital. Traditional parties take place throughout the year.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mwzA\">The city is located at the top of the <span>Brazilian highlands</span> in the country's <span>center-western</span> region. The <span>Paranoá Lake</span> is a large artificial lake that was built to increase the amount of water available and to maintain the region's humidity. It has a <span>marina</span>, and hosts wakeboarders and <span>windsurfers</span>. Diving can also be practiced and one of the main attractions is Vila Amaury, an old village submerged in the lake. This is where the first construction workers of Brasília used to live.</p>\n\n","Angeles":"<p id=\"mwAeY\">Despite the major challenges that were faced by the city, such as the removal of the U.S. <span>Clark Air Base</span> and the <span>Mount Pinatubo</span>'s eruption in 1991, all these have been surpassed by Angeleños.  The improvement in the economy of Angeles was said to have been triggered by the transformation of the U.S. base into <span>Clark Freeport Zone</span>, where the <span>Clark International Airport</span> is located. Angeles is home to an emerging technology industry. Its economy is based also on tourism and gambling. <span>Fields Avenue</span> forms the hub of the night life industry focused in Angeles. With close proximity to an international airport in Clark Freeport, Angeles is visited by foreigners all year round.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Viña del Mar":"<p id=\"mwyg\">Numerous bars and restaurants have recently opened in the area around Plaza México and Avenida San Martín, offering Chilean and international cuisine.

The <span>Valparaiso Sporting Club</span> horse racing track is another major landmark. Jardín Botánico or Parque del Salitre, a large botanical garden on the outskirts of the city, was originally designed and built by an entrepreneur who became wealthy from exploiting <span>saltpeter</span> resources in northern Chile.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"gallery mw-gallery-traditional\" typeof=\"mw:Extension/gallery\" about=\"#mwt81\" data-mw=\"{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;gallery&quot;,&quot;attrs&quot;:{&quot;widths&quot;:&quot;200px&quot;,&quot;heights&quot;:&quot;200px&quot;},&quot;body&quot;:{&quot;extsrc&quot;:&quot;\\nImage:Renaca4.jpg|Panoramic view of [[Reñaca]], Viña del Mar\\nImage:Costa Viña.jpg|Beach in Viña Del Mar\\nFile:Playa Reñaca.JPG|Reñaca\\nFile:palacio carrasco.jpg|Palacio Carrasco\\nFile:Quinta_Vergara_Tree.jpg|Quinta Vergara\\nFile:Beach near Reñaca 1.jpg|Beach near Reñaca\\nFile:Beach near Reñaca 2.jpg|Beach near Reñaca\\nFile:Beach near Reñaca 3.jpg|Beach near Reñaca\\n&quot;}}\" id=\"mwhw\">\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 235px;\" id=\"mwiA\"><div class=\"thumb\" style=\"width: 230px;

The site was once home to an <span>Ainu</span> fishing village called Kushunkotan (in Russian sources, Tamari-Aniva), which was frequented by traders of the <span>Matsumae clan</span> from as early as 1790. On September<span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" id=\"mwOA\">&nbsp;</span>22, 1853, a Russian expedition, commanded by <span>Gennady Nevelskoy</span>, raised the Russian flag at the settlement and renamed it \"Fort Muravyovsky\", after Governor-General of Eastern Siberia <span>Nikolay Muravyov</span>. Nevelskoy left detailed recollections of the landing. He encountered a predominantly Ainu population (at least 600 people; another source mentions only 300 Ainu inhabitants) as well as Japanese nationals who, judging by Nevelskoy's account, exercised authority over the native inhabitants. At the time of Nevelskoy's arrival, the village featured several standing structures—Nevelskoy calls them \"sheds\"—and even a Japanese religious temple. The villagers supposedly welcomed the Russians after they learned about their mission (protecting them from foreign incursion). Of course, the veracity of this account is in doubt, both because Nevelskoy had ulterior motives for claiming that he was \"welcomed\" by the inhabitants, and also because it is not clear to what extent the Russians were able to make themselves understood. The Russians abandoned the settlement on May<span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" id=\"mwRw\">&nbsp;</span>30, 1854, allegedly because their presence there, at the time of the <span>Crimean War</span>, raised the specter of Anglo-French attack, but returned in August 1869, now renaming the town \"Fort Korsakovsky,\" in honor of then-Governor General of Eastern Siberia <span>Mikhail Korsakov</span>. Lingering territorial conflict between Japan and Russia has polarized scholarly opinion of Korsakov's early history, as each side tries to claim priority of early settlement to back up their respective territorial claims in the broader region. In 1875, the whole Sakhalin including the village was ceded to Russia, under the <span>Treaty of Saint Petersburg</span>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Centre-Val de Loire":"<p id=\"mwSQ\">Bordering six other regions, Centre-Val-de-Loire borders the most of all 18 regions in France.

It offers a year-round programme of live music, comedy, film, talks, theatre and children's entertainment. George's House Gallery and Googie's Art Cafe hold frequent exhibitions by local artists and the Folkestone Art Society, established in 1928, holds three annual art exhibitions and publishes an annual art review of work by local artists. <span>Leas Cliff Hall</span> is the biggest entertainment and function venue in Folkestone with a large choice of concerts, comedy and theatre.

Many of the <span>ministries and departments</span> of the island's government are located within the Greater Bridgetown area.  The Public Buildings or <span>parliament</span>, which stand at the heart of the city directly north of Heroes Square, house the third oldest continuous parliament in the <span>British Commonwealth</span>.  Indeed, at one point in the city's early history, Bridgetown was the most important city of all British possessions in the New World due to the city's easterly location in the Caribbean region.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mwPw\">Although the island was totally abandoned or uninhabited when the British landed there, one of the few traces of indigenous pre-existence on the island was a primitive bridge constructed over the <span>Careenage</span> area's swamp at the centre of Bridgetown.  It was thought that this bridge was created by a people indigenous to the <span>Caribbean</span> known as the <span>Tainos</span>. Upon finding the structure, the British settlers began to call what is now the Bridgetown area <i id=\"mwQw\">Indian Bridge</i>.  Scholars widely believe that the Tainos were driven from Barbados to the neighbouring island of <span>Saint Lucia</span>, during an invasion by the <span>Kalinagos</span>, another indigenous people of the region.

Many of the <span>Nepali</span> <span>Hindus</span>, as well as the various Buddhist and other ethnic groups such as the Lepchas, Bhutias, Kiranti Limbus, Tibetans, Yolmos, Gurungs and Tamangs, have their own distinct languages and cultures and yet share a largely harmonious co-existence.</p>\n\n\n<p id=\"mwAc0\">Tourist inflow into Darjeeling had been affected by the political instability in the region, and agitations in the 1980s and 2000s hit the tourism industry hard. However, since 2012, Darjeeling has once again witnessed a steady inflow of both domestic and international tourists. Presently, around 50,000 foreign and 500,000 domestic tourists visit Darjeeling each year, and its repute as the \"Queen of the Hills\" remains unaltered. According to an <i id=\"mwAdQ\">India Today</i> survey published on 23 December 2015, Darjeeling is the third most Googled travel destination among all the tourist destinations in India. Even though there are political instabilities in Darjeeling, its tourism rate is increasing year by year. Many visit this place for food specialities like momos, steamed stick rice, and other steamed foods famous in this  region, as well as to see the natural beauty of the area.</p>","Evesham":"<p id=\"mwAUQ\">Evesham had a distinctive dialect, which locals called \"Asum Grammar\", or \"Asum Grammer\". The editor of the local newspaper quoted extracts from a fictitious dictionary of the language. In 1891, a glossary was published of words and phrases in South-East Worcestershire, comprising the district around Evesham and Pershore. This publication itself built on that of an 1882 author identified only as \"Mrs Chamberlain\".  Prior to the 1882 book, little attention had been paid to the dialect of \"the old Worcestershire folks\", despite it being \"interesting and peculiar\". A decline in the dialect was already being noted, attributed at that time to standardisation of English schooling, something noted also by later writers on English dialects. The dialect continues to decline, but is stronger in older generations. More recent factors in its decline are attributed to changes in the market gardening scene, where the dialect was to be heard at its fullest, and the impact of television. In the local dialect, \"Asum\" is a contraction of the town's name. Asum was an <span>ale</span> produced by the now defunct Evesham Brewery. \"Eve-shum\" is the more common phonetic pronunciation, but \"Eve-uh-shum\" is not uncommon.</p>\n\n\n<!-- Unused refs from original article:\n[http://wychavon.whub.org.uk/home/wdc&#x2D;arts&#x2D;venues listing by Wychavon District Council]\n[http://www.thestage.co.uk/listings/venue.php/2112/arts&#x2D;centre&#x2D;evesham listing by The Stage]\n[http://www.eveshamartscentre.co.uk/ Evesham Arts Centre official website]-->\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mwqQ\">Evesham is situated on a horseshoe-shaped peninsula almost completely surrounded by water in a meander of the River Avon between <span>Stratford-upon-Avon</span> and <span>Tewkesbury</span>.

During the <span>Roman conquest of Britain</span> a decisive battle was fought at the Medway somewhere near Rochester.  The first bridge was subsequently constructed early in the Roman period.

The hard grey stone is one of the most durable materials available and helps to explain why the city's buildings look brand-new when they have been newly cleaned and the cement has been pointed. Unlike other Scottish cities where <span>sandstone</span> has been used, the buildings are not weathering and need very little structural maintenance on their masonry.

This leaves local geologists in a slight quandary: despite the high concentration of geoscientists in the area (courtesy of the oil industry), there is only a vague understanding of what underlies the city. To the south side of the city, coastal cliffs expose high-grade metamorphic rocks of the Grampian Group; to the south-west and west are extensive granites intruded into similar high-grade schists; to the north the metamorphics are intruded by gabbroic complexes instead. The small amount of geophysics done, and occasional building-related exposures, combined with small exposures in the banks of the River Don, suggest that it is actually sited on an inlier of Devonian \"Old Red\" sandstones and silts.

From the 1880s through the 1920s a railway project to connect Pucallpa with the rest of the country via the <span>Ferrocarril Central Andino</span> was started and dropped several times until it was finally abandoned. Pucallpa's isolation finally ended in 1945 with the completion of a highway to <span>Lima</span> through <span>Tingo Maria</span>. The highway allowed the commercialization of regional products to the rest of the country, thus improving the economic outlook of the region and its capital, Pucallpa. However, the heavy rainfalls of the Amazon Rainforest remain a problem as they erode the highway and can even undermine it by causing <span>flash floods</span>.

Settlers also arrived at Dark Hole (or Dark Harbour). The families that made up this community were the Balsoms, Pearces, Vardys, and Seawards. Settlers also arrived at Brook Cove (the Burseys), Broad Cove (the Strongs, Adeys), and Red Beach (the Stanleys). These five communities became part of a new community known as Clarenceville in 1892 when the railway came through.\nThere are two versions of the origin of Clarenville's name. It has been attributed to a memorial to the Duke of Clarence, eldest son of the then Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII) who died in 1892. The other version is that it was named for a son of Prime Minister Sir William Whiteway. However, Sir William had no son by that name.

The people on this narrow strip of land struggled against the waters of the <span>North Sea</span> from the west, and the waters of the <span>IJ</span> and the <span>Haarlem Lake</span> from the east. Haarlem became wealthy with toll revenues that it collected from ships and travellers moving on this busy North-South route. However, as shipping became increasingly important economically, the city of <span>Amsterdam</span> became the main Dutch city of <span>North Holland</span> during the <span>Dutch Golden Age</span>. The town of <span>Halfweg</span> became a <span>suburb</span>, and Haarlem became a quiet <span>bedroom community</span>, and for this reason Haarlem still has many of its central medieval buildings intact. Nowadays many of them are on the Dutch Heritage register known as <span>Rijksmonuments</span>.

The <span>South West Coast Path</span> runs along the entire length of both, around 65% of which is named as <span>Heritage Coast</span>. Before the changes to English counties in 1974, Devon was the <span>third largest county</span> by area and the largest of the counties not divided into county-like divisions (only Yorkshire and Lincolnshire were larger and both were sub-divided into ridings or parts, respectively). Since 1974 the county is ranked fourth by area (due to the creation of Cumbria) <span>amongst ceremonial counties</span> and is the <span>third largest non-metropolitan county</span>. The island of <span>Lundy</span> and the reef of <span>Eddystone</span> are also in Devon. The county has more mileage of road than any other county in England.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mwuw\">Like neighbouring <span>Cornwall</span> to the west, historically Devon has been disadvantaged economically compared to other parts of <span>Southern England</span>, owing to the decline of a number of core industries, notably fishing, mining and farming. Agriculture has been an important industry in Devon since the 19th century. The <span>2001 UK foot and mouth crisis</span> harmed the farming community severely. Since then some parts of the agricultural industry have begun to diversify and recover, with a strong local food sector and many artisan producers. Nonetheless in 2015 the dairy industry was still suffering from the low prices offered for wholesale milk by major dairies and especially large supermarket chains.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Réunion":"<p id=\"mwAnk\">Réunionese culture is a blend (<i id=\"mwAno\">métissage</i>) of European, African, <span>Indian</span>, <span>Chinese</span> and insular traditions.

Partly to reduce flooding, the bed of the Gender stream, which flowed directly through the city centre, was dammed off and filled up after the War, and the course of the Dommel was regulated.

Another program is Patriots of Acre, a community responsibility and youth tourism program that teaches children to become ambassadors for their city. In the summer, the centre runs an Arab-Jewish summer camp for 120 disadvantaged children aged 5–11. Some 1,000 children take part in the Acre Centre's youth club and youth programming every week.

Referred to by the <span>Ligurians</span> as <i id=\"mwgQ\">Monoikos</i>, from the <span>Greek</span> \"μόνοικος\", \"single house\", from \"μόνος\" (<i id=\"mwgw\">monos</i>) \"alone, single\" + \"οἶκος\" (<i id=\"mwhg\">oikos</i>) \"house\", which bears the sense of a people either settled in a \"single habitation\" or of \"living apart\" from others. According to an ancient myth, <span>Hercules</span> passed through the Monaco area and turned away the previous gods. As a result, a temple was constructed there, the temple of Hercules Monoikos. Because the only temple of this area was the \"House\" of Hercules, the city was called Monoikos. It ended up in the hands of the <span>Holy Roman Empire</span>, which gave it to the Genoese. An ousted branch of a Genoese family, the <span>Grimaldi</span>, contested it for a hundred years before actually gaining control. Though the <span>Republic of Genoa</span> would last until the 19th century, they allowed the Grimaldi family to keep Monaco, and, likewise, both France and <span>Spain</span> left it alone for hundreds of years. France did not annex it until the <span>French Revolution</span>, but after the defeat of <span>Napoleon</span> it was put under the care of the <span>Kingdom of Sardinia</span>. In the 19th century, when <span>Sardinia</span> became a part of <span>Italy</span>, the region came under French influence again but France allowed it to remain independent. Like France, Monaco was overrun by the <span>Axis powers</span> during the <span>Second World War</span> and for a short time was administered by Italy, then the <span>Third Reich</span>, before finally being liberated. Although the occupation lasted for just a short time, it meant the deportation of the <span>Jewish</span> population and execution of several <span>resistance</span> members from Monaco. Since then Monaco has been independent.  It has taken some steps towards <span>integration with the European Union</span>.</p>\n\n","Oklahoma City":"<p id=\"mwww\">Oklahoma City lies along one of the primary corridors into <span>Texas</span> and <span>Mexico</span>, and is a three-hour drive from the <span>Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex</span>.

With the establishment of the Southern Pacific rail line in 1926, the opening of the Union Station in 1923, and the creation of Sky Harbor airport by the end of the decade, the city became more easily accessible. The Great Depression affected Phoenix, but Phoenix had a diverse economy and by 1934 the recovery was underway. At the conclusion of <span>World War II</span>, the valley's economy surged, as many men who had completed their military training at the bases in and around Phoenix returned with their families. The construction industry, spurred on by the city's growth, further expanded with the development of <span>Sun City</span>. It became the template for suburban development in post-WWII America, and Sun City became the template for retirement communities when it opened in 1960.

They are also called Delaware Indians, and their historical territory was along the <span>Delaware River</span> <span>watershed</span>, western <span>Long Island</span>, and the <span>Lower Hudson Valley</span>. Most Lenape were pushed out of their Delaware homeland during the 18th century by expanding European colonies, exacerbated by losses from intertribal conflicts. Lenape communities were weakened by newly introduced diseases, mainly <span>smallpox</span>, and violent conflict with Europeans. <span>Iroquois</span> people occasionally fought the Lenape. Surviving Lenape moved west into the upper <span>Ohio River</span> basin. The <span>American Revolutionary War</span> and United States' independence pushed them further west. In the 1860s, the United States government sent most Lenape remaining in the <span>eastern United States</span> to the <span>Indian Territory</span> (present-day Oklahoma and surrounding territory) under the <span>Indian removal</span> policy. In the 21st century, most Lenape reside in <span>Oklahoma</span>, with some communities living also in <span>Wisconsin</span>, <span>Ontario</span> (Canada), and in their traditional homelands.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"gallery mw-gallery-packed\" typeof=\"mw:Extension/gallery\" about=\"#mwt405\" data-mw=\"{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;gallery&quot;,&quot;attrs&quot;:{&quot;mode&quot;:&quot;packed&quot;},&quot;body&quot;:{&quot;extsrc&quot;:&quot;\\nFile:The Birth of Pennsylvania 1680 cph.3g07157.jpg|''The Birth of Pennsylvania'', 1680, by [[Jean Leon Gerome Ferris]] -

Former Prime Ministers of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew and Goh Chok Tong, have stated that Singapore does not fit the traditional description of a nation, calling it a society-in-transition, pointing out the fact that Singaporeans do not all speak the same language, share the same religion, or have the same customs.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mwBhU\">Tourism in Singapore is a major industry and contributor to the <span>Singaporean economy</span>, attracting 18.5 million international tourists in 2018, more than 3 times of Singapore's total population.

It is unknown when the first Spanish settled in Jinotega. It had to be after the year 1581, because the Spanish Census of 1581 shows it was still an Indian town. Even in 1703 when missioner Fray Margil de Jesus visited Jinotega there were no permanent Spanish settlers there. However by 1731 there were some permanent ones, like Juan de Castro, other Spaniard lastnames like Gadea, Duarte, Altamirano, Alburquerque, Fray Juan de Zeledon, and some soldiers. Zeledon is said to have invited some nephews to come here who let descendants who still live there: some of them are Zeledon of La Concordia, Umure and Ocotal Espeso and Pacsila, idilic communities located between the cities of Matagalpa and Jinotega.\nAccording to locals, Jinotega was founded when five Spanish families moved north from Nueva Segovia by year 1700 to settle the \"dry zone\" or \"zona seca\" community of Jocomico, Naranjo, Umure, Ocotal Espeso, which lies bout 15 kilometers south of the city.  The city of Jinotega was formed in the middle of a bowl-like mountainous area.  In 1703 a large cross was placed by Spanish friar Margil de Jesus at the highest point of Chirinagua in the western edge of the city, now called Cerro de la Cruz. It is illuminated at night, and tourists organize hiking tours to this peak.</p>\n\n\n\n","Slovak Paradise National Park":"<p id=\"mwhg\">The best known tourist centres and resorts are <i id=\"mwhw\">Čingov</i> and <i id=\"mwiA\">Podlesok</i> in the north, <span>Dedinky</span> in the south and the only tourist centre located inside the National Park, <i id=\"mwig\">Kláštorisko</i>, with ruins of the <span>Carthusian</span> <span>monastery</span>.

Some of the earliest records show that Khwarezm was conquered by the Arabs in 712, and Kunya-Urgench was given the Arabic name \"Gurgandj\". The city rose to prominence between the 10th and 14th centuries as the Khwarezmian capital, and as an important trading centre, competing in fame and population with many other <span>Central Asian</span> cities, such as <span>Bukhara</span>.  It had become highly prosperous due to its strategic location on the main trade routes from the south to the north, and the west to the east, vastly contributing to the development of science and culture in Central Asia.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Shakhrizabz":"<p id=\"mwdA\">In 1980s the Uzbek Soviet band <span>Yalla</span> wrote a song about Shahrisabz.</p>\n<p id=\"mwJA\">Formerly known as <b id=\"mwJQ\">Kesh</b> or <b id=\"mwJg\">Kish</b> (\"heart-pleasing\") and tentatively identified with the ancient <b id=\"mwJw\">Nautaca</b>, Shahrisabz is one of <span>Central Asia</span>’s most ancient cities.

In 1909, French troops invaded the Kingdom and established a garrison in Abéché. <span>France</span> took power, forcing the sultan to renounce his throne.  At that time, Abéché was the largest city in Chad with 28,000 people, but major epidemics reduced the population to 6000 in 1919. In 1935, the sultanate was restored by orders of the French government, and Muhammed Ouarada, heir to the throne after his father became king.

The city centre, which developed in the 17th and 18th centuries, has still preserved the old wooden buildings which form small and narrow streets. The oldest wooden building in Kurzeme put up in 1670 can be found near the Town square. The Old Town hall was built in the 17th century. The town square, since the very origins of the settlement, was a place where townspeople used to gather. The tradition has survived: the pulse of the town is best felt in the central square, a venue for weavers' exhibitions, traditional festivities and other events.\n<b id=\"mwQQ\">The Venta waterfall</b> (<span>Ventas rumba</span>) is the widest waterfall in Europe. This 240 meter wide naturally formed waterfall is associated with a number of legends and historic events.

The ancient Kuldiga town of <span>Couronians</span> – a fortified castle mound and a settlement were located 3,5<span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" id=\"mwJg\">&nbsp;</span>km to the North down the River Venta on its left bank. The castle mound can be observed nowadays still. It is located on a bank of the River Venta on the foreland between the deep gully of the River Veckuldīga and the ancient valley of the Venta. The Site of the Castle itself is located in the several hectare wide area, but together with the Old City of Kuldiga – the area of more than ten hectares. There might have been a port by the River Veckuldīga.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n","Yangmingshan National Park":"<p id=\"mwSw\">Due to the effects of post-volcanic activity and precipitation, soil in the region is highly acidic. With the influence of the northeast monsoon and the area's microclimates, winter temperatures are much lower than the surrounding areas.

Some medium and high altitude plants can be found here such as <span>bird-lime tree</span> and <span>hairy Japanese maple</span>. Vegetation groups can be divided into subtropical monsoon rain forests, temperate evergreen broadleaf forests and mountain ridge grasslands.

In 1273, his followers in Konya established the <span>Mevlevi</span> <span>Sufi</span> order of <span>Islam</span> and became known as the <span>Whirling Dervishes</span>. Konya has the reputation of being one of the more religiously conservative metropolitan centers in Turkey.

As of 1920, the British described it as \"the chief emporium of Arabian trade, receiving the small quantities of native produce, and supplying the modest wants of the interior and of most of the smaller Arabian ports.\" At the docks, the city provided <span>coal</span> to passing ships. The only item being produced by the city, as of 1920, was <span>salt</span>. Also, the port was the stop ships had to take when entering the <span>Bab-el-Mandeb</span>; this was how cities like Mecca had received goods by ship. <span>Yemen Airlines</span>, the national airline of South Yemen, had its head office in Aden. On 15 May 1996, Yemen Airlines merged with <span>Yemenia</span>.</p>\n\n\n\n","Chernivtsi":"<p id=\"mw2A\">Chernivtsi is located in the historic region of <span>Bukovina</span>, which is currently shared between Romania (south) and Ukraine (north).

The canyon itself was created by the incision of the Colorado River and its tributaries after the <span>Colorado Plateau</span> was uplifted, causing the Colorado River system to develop along its present path.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mwKw\">\"Grand Canyon\" was officially designated a national park on February 26, 1919, though the landmark had been well known to Americans for over thirty years prior. In 1903, President <span>Theodore Roosevelt</span> visited the site and said: \"The Grand Canyon fills me with awe. It is beyond comparison—beyond description; absolutely unparalleled through-out the wide world... Let this great wonder of nature remain as it now is. Do nothing to mar its grandeur, sublimity and loveliness. You cannot improve on it.

Much of Turkey's cultural scene had its roots in Istanbul, and by the 1980s and 1990s Istanbul reemerged globally as a city whose cultural significance is not solely based on its past glory.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mwAhA\">Istanbul is in north-western <span>Turkey</span> within the <span>Marmara Region</span> on a total area of <span about=\"#mwt578\" typeof=\"mw:Transclusion\" data-mw=\"{&quot;parts&quot;:[{&quot;template&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;convert&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;./Template:Convert&quot;},&quot;params&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;5343&quot;},&quot;2&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;km2&quot;},&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;sqmi&quot;},&quot;sp&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;us&quot;}},&quot;i&quot;:0}}]}\" id=\"mwAhM\">5,343 square kilometers (2,063</span><span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" about=\"#mwt578\">&nbsp;</span><span about=\"#mwt578\">sq</span><span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" about=\"#mwt578\">&nbsp;</span><span about=\"#mwt578\">mi)</span>. The <span>Bosphorus</span>, which connects the <span>Sea of Marmara</span> to the <span>Black Sea</span>, divides the city into a European, <span>Thracian</span> side—comprising the historic and economic centers—and an Asian, <span>Anatolian</span> side. The city is further divided by the <span>Golden Horn</span>, a natural harbor bounding the peninsula where the former Byzantium and Constantinople were founded. The confluence of the Sea of Marmara, the Bosphorus, and the Golden Horn at the heart of present-day Istanbul has deterred attacking forces for thousands of years and remains a prominent feature of the city's landscape.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n","Bristol":"<p id=\"mwjg\"><span>Archaeological</span> finds, including flint tools believed to be between 300,000 and 126,000<span class=\"nowrap\" about=\"#mwt102\" typeof=\"mw:Transclusion\" data-mw=\"{&quot;parts&quot;:[{&quot;template&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;nbsp&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;./Template:Nbsp&quot;},&quot;params&quot;:{},&quot;i&quot;:0}}]}\" id=\"mwkA\"><span typeof=\"mw:Entity\">&nbsp;</span></span>years old made with the <span>Levallois technique</span>, indicate the presence of <span>Neanderthals</span> in the <span>Shirehampton</span> and <span>St Annes</span> areas of Bristol during the <span>Middle Palaeolithic</span>. <span>Iron Age</span> <span>hill forts</span> near the city are at <span>Leigh Woods</span> and <span>Clifton Down</span>, on the side of the <span>Avon Gorge</span>, and on <span>Kings Weston Hill</span> near <span>Henbury</span>. A <span>Roman</span> settlement, Abona, existed at what is now <span>Sea Mills</span> (connected to <span>Bath</span> by a <span>Roman road</span>); another was at the present-day <span>Inns Court</span>. Isolated <span>Roman villas</span> and small <span>forts</span> and settlements were also scattered throughout the area.</p>\n\n\n<p id=\"mwA9Q\">Bristol has a long history of trade, originally exporting wool cloth and importing fish, wine, grain and dairy products; later imports were tobacco, tropical fruits and plantation goods. Major imports are motor vehicles, grain, timber, <span>produce</span> and petroleum products. Since the 13th century, the rivers have been modified for docks; during the 1240s, the Frome was diverted into a deep, man-made channel (known as Saint Augustine's Reach) which flowed into the River Avon.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","New York City":"<p id=\"mwC00\">New York City has been described as the cultural capital of the world by the <span>diplomatic consulates</span> of <span>Iceland</span> and <span>Latvia</span> and by New York's <span>Baruch College</span>. A book containing a series of essays titled <i id=\"mwC1g\">New York, Culture Capital of the World, 1940–1965</i> has also been published as showcased by the <span>National Library of Australia</span>. In describing New York, author <span>Tom Wolfe</span> said, \"Culture just seems to be in the air, like part of the weather.\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mwA1o\">New York City is situated in the <span>Northeastern United States</span>, in southeastern New York State, approximately halfway between Washington, D.C. and <span>Boston</span>. The location at the mouth of the <span>Hudson River</span>, which feeds into a naturally sheltered harbor and then into the Atlantic Ocean, has helped the city grow in significance as a trading port. Most of New York City is built on the three islands of <span>Long Island</span>, Manhattan, and Staten Island.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Borobudur":"<p id=\"mwAmQ\">The archaeological excavation into Borobudur during reconstruction suggests that adherents of Hinduism or a pre-Indic faith had already begun to erect a large structure on Borobudur's hill before the site was appropriated by Buddhists. The foundations are unlike any Hindu or Buddhist shrine structures, and therefore, the initial structure is considered more indigenous Javanese than Hindu or Buddhist.</p>\n\n\n<p id=\"mwA9s\">Apart from the story of the <span>Buddhist cosmology</span> carved in stone, Borobudur has many statues of various Buddhas. The cross-legged statues are seated in a <span>lotus position</span> and distributed on the five square platforms (the <i id=\"mwA94\">Rupadhatu</i> level), as well as on the top platform (the <i id=\"mwA98\">Arupadhatu</i> level).</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Moscow":"<p id=\"mwBQU\">One of the most notable art museums in Moscow is the <span>Tretyakov Gallery</span>, which was founded by <span>Pavel Tretyakov</span>, a wealthy patron of the arts who donated a large private collection to the city. The Tretyakov Gallery is split into two buildings. The Old Tretyakov gallery, the original gallery in the <span>Tretyakovskaya</span> area on the south bank of the Moskva River, houses works in the classic Russian tradition. The works of famous pre-<span>Revolutionary</span> painters, such as <span>Ilya Repin</span>, as well as the works of early Russian <span>icon painters</span> can be found here. Visitors can even see rare originals by early 15th-century <span>iconographer</span> <span>Andrei Rublev</span>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Nashville":"<p id=\"mwA4U\">Much of the city's cultural life has revolved around its large university community. Particularly significant in this respect were two groups of critics and writers who were associated with <span>Vanderbilt University</span> in the early 20th century: the <span>Fugitives</span> and the <span>Agrarians</span>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mwAsg\">As the \"home of country music\", Nashville has become a major music recording and production center. The <span>Big Three record labels</span>, as well as numerous independent labels, have offices in Nashville, mostly in the <span>Music Row</span> area. Nashville has been the headquarters of guitar company <span>Gibson</span> since 1984. Since the 1960s, Nashville has been the second-largest music production center (after New York) in the United States.

St. Louis also boasts the largest <span>Ethical Culture Society</span> in the United States, and consistently ranks as one of the most generous cities in the United States, ranking ninth in 2013. Several places of worship in the city are noteworthy, such as the <span>Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis</span>, home of the world's largest mosaic installation.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mwA3Q\">The <span>gross domestic product</span> of the St. Louis metro area was $160 billion in 2016, up from $155 billion the previous year. The <span>gross metropolitan product</span> of Greater St. Louis was $146 billion in 2014, the 21st-highest in the country, up from $144 billion in 2013, $138.4 billion in 2012, and $133.1 billion in 2011. The St. Louis metropolitan area had a per-capita GDP of $48,738 in 2014, up 1.6% from the previous year. In 2007, manufacturing in the city conducted nearly $11<span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" id=\"mwA3k\">&nbsp;</span>billion in business, followed by the health care and social service industry with $3.5<span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" id=\"mwA3o\">&nbsp;</span>billion; professional or technical services with $3.1<span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" id=\"mwA3s\">&nbsp;</span>billion; and the retail trade with $2.5<span typeof=\"mw:Entity\" id=\"mwA3w\">&nbsp;</span>billion. The health care sector was the area's biggest employer with 34,000 workers, followed by administrative and support jobs, 24,000; manufacturing, 21,000, and food service, 20,000.</p>\n\n"}
