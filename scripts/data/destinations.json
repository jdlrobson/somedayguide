San Ignacio, or Cayo as it is called, is located on the Macal river, and makes a good and affordable base for exploration of the stunning regions around it, with plenty of day trips to be taken and several decent tour guides willing to take you. It's also an important transit town en route to or from Guatemala.","thumbnail":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Windy_Hill.JPG/440px-Windy_Hill.JPG","thumbnail__source":"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Windy_Hill.JPG","links":[],"sights":[{"description":"A Mayan sacrificial burial site near San Ignacio. The site is contained entirely within a cave system, and access to the relics is gained via some 500 m (1,600 ft) of climbing over rocks, wading and swimming through water that is at times over 1.5 m (4.9 ft) deep. The cave was a sacred site for the Mayans and it contains many examples of pottery, ceramics, and stoneware, as well as several sets of human sacrificial remains, one of which (known as the \"Crystal Maiden\") has been almost entirely covered in limestone crystals by the water in the cave. The site is a 45-minute drive from San Ignacio, and, due to the caving aspect, it may only be visited when accompanied by an official guide (who will provide appropriate safety equipment) and you can't take photos inside. Most tour companies in San Ignacio are able to offer officially guided tours.","title":"Actun Tunichil Muknal","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/Actun_Tunichil_Muknal.jpg/90px-Actun_Tunichil_Muknal.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Actun_Tunichil_Muknal.jpg"},{"description":"The main attraction in the town. Cahal Pech is a smallish set of Mayan ruins that were abandoned around 800-900 AD. There is an indoor museum displaying artifacts, a site plan, and information on the ruins in a regional context. There are, allegedly, guided tours, but these are unneeded, as the site is easy to traverse. The entire site should take 1-2 hours at most for a thorough exploration. Once at the ruins, the site is fairly flat, but Cahal Pech is at the top of the hill overlooking San Ignacio. The walk uphill to it from the main town is quite exhausting and is difficult even from the San Ignacio Resort Hotel on the hill. If you have any disability, or are in poor physical condition, you will want to drive.","title":"Cahal Pech","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Cahal_Pech_Jul_10_2015_49.jpg/120px-Cahal_Pech_Jul_10_2015_49.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Cahal_Pech_Jul_10_2015_49.jpg"},{"description":"Biggest ruin in Belize, yet partially unexcavated, so you really feel like you are in a national park on a ruin.

In the top station of the cable car, there is a hotel (€30 for a double room [2013]) and a tourist agency offering various activities like horse riding, trekking, excursions, sky sports, ski etc. The area has a limited number of hotels and restaurants, but it is great for taking a breath of fresh air, mountain sports, or to just get out of the city for a while.The Pellumba Cave in the area is worth a visit.

A variety of positions were added in the 18th century, but the complex was finally disestablished as a military post in 1891 when it was superseded by a ring of forts around Namur to provide better protection against the improved range of artillery at the time. It saw battle a last time during the German invasion of World War I, after which the new fortifications took over its defensive role.

These are reminiscent of the museum in the film Planet of the Apes.","title":"Ethnological Museum, Chittagong","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/Entrance_of_Ethnological_Museum_%2803%29.jpg/120px-Entrance_of_Ethnological_Museum_%2803%29.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Entrance_of_Ethnological_Museum_(03).jpg"},{"description":"The area of Eco Park is about 996 acres (403 ha) which is established at forest side of Chandranath Hills of Sitakunda.","title":"Botanical Garden and Eco-Park, Sitakunda","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Entrance%2C_Botanical_Garden_and_Eco-Park%2C_Sitakunda_%2801%29.jpg/120px-Entrance%2C_Botanical_Garden_and_Eco-Park%2C_Sitakunda_%2801%29.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Entrance,_Botanical_Garden_and_Eco-Park,_Sitakunda_(01).jpg"},{"description":"The shipbreaking yards near the Indian Ocean are Chittagong's international claim to fame, but for the wrong reasons; these are considered one of the most polluted places on Earth with highly dangerous practices and hazardous working conditions. Greenpeace is actively campaigning against them and trying to bring this issue further into the light. Tourists are not usually welcome, but some travellers have been able to sweet-talk the gate-keeper and get amazing photos of massive ships being dismantled for parts and steel. There are many breaking yards stretching for miles, so start at one end and try your luck until you have success. Keep your wits about you, safety practices leave something to be desired. It's also wise to keep your camera hidden until you're out of view of the officials, lest you be mistaken for a journalist out to do them harm.

must see for any tourist in Baku. The complex contains the main building of the palace, Divanhane, the burial-vaults, the shah's mosque with a minaret, Seyid Yahya Bakuvi's mausoleum, a portal in the east - Murad's gate, a reservoir and the remnants of the bath-house. - The main building of the complex was started in 1411 by Shirvanshah Sheykh Ibrahim I. The two-storey building of the palace numbers about 50 different dimensions and outlines of the constructions connected with 3 narrow winding staircases. The big lancet portal directly leads from the courtyard to the second floor, into a high octahedral lodging covered with a cupola. A small, also an octagonal vestibule, located behind it, connects it with the rest of the lodgings in the palace. - Divankhana is a small stone pavilion. It is situated inside a small courtyard surrounded by a gallery-arcade on three sides. The Divankhana pavilion consists of an octahedral hall covered with a stone cupola both inside and outside. The well-proportioned high portal of the main entrance is decorated with an ornament and Arabic inscription. The ornament pictures the interlacing fig and vine leaves. The portal is also decorated with two medallions inside of which there are inscriptions in Kufic Arabic. - The Mausoleum of the Shirvanshahs is of a rectangular shape and crowned with a hexahedral cupola which is decorated from outside with multi-radial stars. The inscription on the entrance doorway indicates the purpose of the building, \"Khalilullah I, the greatest Soltan, Great Shirvanshah, the namesake of the divine prophet, the defender of the religion ordered to construct this light burial-vault for his mother and son in 839\" (1435–1436). On two drop-shaped medallions in the flannel parts of the portal there are inscriptions with the architect's name - Memar Ali (architect Ali). - The Palace Mosque (1430s) is situated in the lower court of the complex. The laconicism of its prismatic volumes, completed with two slightly pointed cupolas, is shaded by a well-proportioned vertical line of the minaret rising above in the north-eastern corner of the building. There are 2 chapels for prayers in the mosque: a hall of a large size for men and a hall of a small size for women, also a couple of small subsidiary rooms. There is an inscription laid under the stalactite belt of the minaret which reads, \"The greatest Soltan Khalilullah I ordered to build this minaret. May Allah exalt the days of his governing and reign. The year of 845\" (1441–1442). - Seyid Yahya Bakuvi's Mausoleum is situated in the southern part of the complex. Seyid Yahya Bakuvi was a royal scholar in the court of Shirvanshah Khalilullah. The Mausoleum is of an octahedral shape and covered with an octahedral marquee. It consists of ground and underground parts. The upper part of the Mausoleum served to perform the cult rites, and the lower one housed the sepulchral vault. There are three small lancet windows with a stone bar - shabaka on the southern, eastern and western verges of the Mausoleum. - The Shirvanshahs' Palace complex also includes the portal of Eastern Gates, the so-called \"Sultan Murad's Gate\" (1585). It was built within the walls of the citadel rather later than all the other constructions of the complex during Ottoman occupation of 1585-1603. The gates were named by them in honor of Sultan Murad III. - The Palace Bath-house is situated on the lowest terrace of the complex. It was discovered in 1939 and dates to 17th century. The archaeological excavations exposed a big bath-house consisting of 26 rooms. On the basis of the surviving remains of the walls of the bath-house one can say that its rooms used to be covered with cupolas and the light penetrated through the openings in the cupolas. The bath-house was semi-underground for keeping the heat in winter and the cool in summer.","title":"Palace of the Shirvanshahs","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Palace_of_Shirvanshahs_common.JPG/120px-Palace_of_Shirvanshahs_common.JPG","thumbnail__source":"File:Palace_of_Shirvanshahs_common.JPG"},{"description":"Plan of the mosque is rectangular. There is a small hall, small prayer room for women and serving rooms. The northern portal, rotated to a burial vault of Shirvanshahs is more solemn than the eastern one.

Mihrab is located in the southern end of the palace. Cupola area over one a tier women prayer room ceding to cupola of the hall with its dimensions and replacing its outlines. Aperture of the mosque’s portal is clearly described on severe background of prismatic volume, ended with two cupolas with slightly sharpening calottes. - Minaret.

A popular make-out spot with a great view and good but overpriced cafe and restaurant. Large TV and radio antennas line some of its broad peak. You can take a scenic drive through the heavily forested Mount Coot-tha Reserve to the peak to see the almost-360° views of Brisbane and the surrounding region. The mountain is 287 m (941 ft) above sea level and forms the eastern extent of the Taylor Range. It is the most northern part of Australia to record snow. It is a prominent landmark approximately 6 km (4 mi) to the west of the Brisbane central business district and is visible from much of the city. Before the Moreton Bay penal settlement, Mount Coot-tha was the home of the Turrbal Aboriginal people. Early Brisbane people called it One Tree Hill when bush at the top of the mountain was cleared except for one large eucalypt tree. The Aboriginal people of the area used to come to the mountain to collect ‘ku-ta’ (honey) that was produced by the native stingless bee. Mount Coot-tha (Place of Honey), a derivative of the indigenous term, replaced the title ‘One Tree Hill' in 1880 when the area was declared a Public Recreation Reserve. Car is the most effective way to enjoy Mount Cootha at your own pace. There is ample parking at the peak. One can also hike the marked trail from the mountain's foot. See one of the best views of Brisbane. It is best to arrive just before dusk or dawn so you can enjoy the transition from day to night. Drive to the peak for a picnic dinner and admire the views. There are several walking tracks through the forests that surround the summit; some are difficult. It is a great place from which to watch the Riverfire fireworks in Sep.","title":"Mount Coot-tha, Queensland","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Mount-Coot-tha-and-TV-Towers_QLD.jpg/120px-Mount-Coot-tha-and-TV-Towers_QLD.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Mount-Coot-tha-and-TV-Towers_QLD.jpg"},{"description":"The world's largest subtropical garden in a city centre and home to 1,800 unique species of plants.

It’s also possible to enter the old monastery attached to the side of the church and climb its bell tower.","title":"Church of Saint Michael (Olomouc)","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Olomouc_Michal_01.JPG/120px-Olomouc_Michal_01.JPG","thumbnail__source":"File:Olomouc_Michal_01.JPG"},{"description":"","title":"Olomouc Zoo","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Pohled_z_vyhl%C3%ADdkov%C3%A9_v%C4%9B%C5%BEe.jpg/120px-Pohled_z_vyhl%C3%ADdkov%C3%A9_v%C4%9B%C5%BEe.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Pohled_z_vyhlídkové_věže.jpg"}],"climate":[]},"Cocos Island National Park":{"lat":5.518889,"lon":-87.071667,"title":"Cocos Island National Park","summary":"Cocos Island is a nationally protected jungle-covered island and national park off the coast of Costa Rica.

The village, which is the world's biggest settlement on stilts, has been on the river for over one thousand years and was the capital of the Bruneian Empire. The water village people are very friendly and many open up their homes to visitors year-round. For a tour by boat, water taxis can be found by walking along the Brunei river or the main market in Bandar Seri Begawan and waving one down. Try to negotiate the price down—you shouldn't pay more than B$30 for an hour-long tour (B$15 for half an hour) of Kampong Ayer. Even though the water taxis are not wheelchair-friendly, their drivers are very willing to lend a hand and even team up and carry a person in a wheelchair on board; ask for a larger boat though.But to really experience the water village, you've got to walk around and explore it. You can take a water taxi across for $1 per person (a 2-minute ride). Ask the driver to take you to the gallery (4.884202114.9446451\n\n Kampong Ayer Cultural & Tourism Gallery), which has a detailed exhibition of the history of Kampong Ayer and some lovely artistic souvenirs for sale. The gallery is open 9AM–5PM, but closes Friday 11AM–2:30PM for Friday prayers. The observation tower next to the gallery has views of the water village and the city center. Then don't just stay at the edge of the village near the gallery – go into the village and walk around. Not many tourists seem to go in, so you may get curious hellos from residents, especially children. You'll see people going about their ordinary routines, which feels almost surreal since it's all suspended a few meters above the river. If you look around you might spot a mosque, schools, whimsically colorful buildings, and even chickens. The boardwalks might make you nervous, but there's no reason to worry – just watch your step. They're more stable than they look, and even if you did somehow lose your balance and fall in, it's just a short swim to the nearest ladder – in a way it's safer than walking next to a busy street. Don't wear high heels though.If you don't want to shell out for the ride, you can also walk into the village – start from behind the Sultan's Mosque or from the other bank in Batu Satu.","title":"Kampong Ayer","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/BN-bsb-kampong-ayer.jpg/120px-BN-bsb-kampong-ayer.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:BN-bsb-kampong-ayer.jpg"},{"title":"Istana Nurul Iman","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Istana-nurul-iman.jpg/120px-Istana-nurul-iman.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Istana-nurul-iman.jpg"},{"description":"ethnographic museum in Kota Batu, Brunei","title":"Malay Technology Museum","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/cd/Malay_technology_museum_BSB.JPG/120px-Malay_technology_museum_BSB.JPG","thumbnail__source":"File:Malay_technology_museum_BSB.JPG"}],"climate":[]},"Aalborg":{"lat":57.05,"lon":9.93,"title":"Aalborg","summary":"   \nAalborg is the largest city in North Jutland, Denmark.

Here you can enjoy the outgoing culture and natural beauty of coastal Brazil in a less dangerous place than Rio de Janeiro, Fortaleza, or Recife.","thumbnail":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/Florianopolis_downtown_night2.jpg/700px-Florianopolis_downtown_night2.jpg","thumbnail__source":"Florianopolis_downtown_night2.jpg","links":[{"href":"http://www.catarinense.net","text":"Catarinense"},{"href":"http://www.reunidas.com.br","text":"Reunidas"},{"href":"http://www.santoanjo.com.br","text":"Santo Anjo"},{"href":"http://www.eucatur.com.br/","text":"Eucatur"}],"sights":[{"description":"One of the most beautiful buildings in the city, at Praça XV de Novembro.","title":"Our Lady of Exile and St. Catherine of Alexandria Cathedral, Florianópolis","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Florianopolis_catedral_metropolitana.JPG/80px-Florianopolis_catedral_metropolitana.JPG","thumbnail__source":"File:Florianopolis_catedral_metropolitana.JPG"},{"description":"The postcard symbol of the city, inaugurated in 1926 linking the island to the mainland.","title":"Hercilio Luz Bridge","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Ponte_Herc%C3%ADlio_Luz_Florianopolis.jpg/120px-Ponte_Herc%C3%ADlio_Luz_Florianopolis.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Ponte_Hercílio_Luz_Florianopolis.jpg"},{"description":"district in Santa Catarina, Brazil","title":"Lagoa da Conceição","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Vista_da_Lagoa_da_trilha_de_Ratones.jpg/120px-Vista_da_Lagoa_da_trilha_de_Ratones.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Vista_da_Lagoa_da_trilha_de_Ratones.jpg"},{"description":"","title":"Canasvieiras","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Canasvieiras.jpg/120px-Canasvieiras.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Canasvieiras.jpg"},{"description":"","title":"Praia Brava"},{"description":"","title":"Jurerê"},{"description":"","title":"Praia dos Ingleses","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Praia_dos_Ingleses%2C_Florian%C3%B3polis_%28janeiro_2006%29.jpg/120px-Praia_dos_Ingleses%2C_Florian%C3%B3polis_%28janeiro_2006%29.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Praia_dos_Ingleses,_Florianópolis_(janeiro_2006).jpg"},{"description":"","title":"Mole Beach","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/Florianopolis_praia_mole.JPG/120px-Florianopolis_praia_mole.JPG","thumbnail__source":"File:Florianopolis_praia_mole.JPG"},{"description":"","title":"Barra da Lagoa","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Brazil_location_map.svg/120px-Brazil_location_map.svg.png","thumbnail__source":"File:Brazil_location_map.svg"},{"description":"","title":"Mozambique Beach","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Praia_de_Mo%C3%A7ambique.jpg/120px-Praia_de_Mo%C3%A7ambique.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Praia_de_Moçambique.jpg"},{"description":"","title":"Campeche, Florianópolis","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Campeche_praia.jpg/120px-Campeche_praia.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Campeche_praia.jpg"},{"description":"","title":"Praia de Naufragados","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/NaufragadosBeachFlorian%C3%B3polis.jpg/120px-NaufragadosBeachFlorian%C3%B3polis.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:NaufragadosBeachFlorianópolis.jpg"}],"climate":[]},"Rincón de la Vieja Volcano National Park":{"lat":10.83,"lon":-85.32388889,"title":"Rincón de la Vieja Volcano National Park","summary":"Rincón de la Vieja Volcano National Park (Parque Nacional Rincon de la Vieja) is a park of 14,161 hectares covering a dry tropical forest region in the provinces of Guanacaste and Alajuela , centered around the volcano, Rincón de la Vieja, and the surrounding volcanic and natural features.

This was one of the bloodiest conflicts in recorded history — some estimates put the death toll higher than for World War I, and it was certainly much worse than the American Civil War at about the same time, even though the Chinese used more primitive weapons. It was a crucial moment in China's relationship with the West, modernity, and its relationship to its own imperial history. It was partly a religious movement; the leader claimed to be God's second son, Jesus' younger brother. The quasi-Christian, peasant-led rebellion overran an area greater than Texas with Nanjing as its capital. At different times it threatened both the foreign settlements in Shanghai and the Qing government in Beijing, though it did not take either. On exhibit are documents relating to Taiping history and the grinding reduction of their movement by enterprising Qing generals and their European auxiliaries, culminating in the siege of Nanjing.

The Rousse Regional Historical Museum was established in 1904. Its basis are the archaeological collections of Karel and Hermenguild Shkorpil, as well as of the naturalist Vasil Kovachev, which were gathered in the \"Knyaz Boris\" men's high school of Rousse. The museum holds approximately 140,000 items, including: prehistoric pottery and idol plastic arts.

The façade's design resembles the style of houses in Plovdiv. The frescoes at the upper floor were crafted in 1896. The exposition represents the role of Rousse as a gateway towards Europe, and the influx of European urban culture into Bulgaria at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century.

The landscaped park around the base of the exterior walls and moat also makes for a pleasant stroll and gives a different perspective on the battlements and towers. The wall is lit up at night and makes for a pleasant stroll.

The museum is easily accessible and a must-see for everyone interested in Cambodia's horrific past. The infamous \"skull map\" has been dismantled, although there are still skulls stacked in cabinets, implements of torture and disturbing photographs of people dying. For an introduction and further reading, try David Chandler's Voices from S-21 (ISBN 0520222474). Documentary movie S-21 can be purchased in Phnom Penh for USD1.50-2. There is also a short movie screening featuring some survivors that plays at 09:30 upstairs in the far building. A hefty slice of your Tuol Sleng entrance fee will go into the pocket of the museum's director, who is the son of the responsible government minister. (This is perhaps the main reason the museum is in rather shabby condition, and the displays so unimaginative.) And a warning to those who patronize the souvenir shop. Don't get conned into buying some vintage Rolex, Patek Philippe, or Omega watches. They are fakes and are worthless. The owner is very convincing and will tell you that it is a collection from her husband. Instead, right across from the museum (No 54 & 56, St 113, Phnom Penh is a little shop called CHA (http://www3.online.com.kh/users/wthanchashop) that sells inexpensive handmade goods that are made by women disabled from polio and land mines.

It was built in honor of the Sacred Heart of Jesus in a neo-gothic style with Romanesque Revival elements, and modeled after the Notre-Dame of Dijon. Construction of the cathedral began on 25 August 1884, under Austro-Hungarian reign, was carried out by the Viennese contractor Baron Karl Schwarz, and supervised by architect Josip Vancaš. The cathedral was the scene of peace demonstrations in fall 1991 before the Bosnian War broke out, and subsequently damaged during the Siege of Sarajevo. The design above the door to the entrance is part of the flag and seal of the Sarajevo administrative canton and the Romanesque towers are featured on the flag and coat of arms of Sarajevo, making the building a symbol of the city. The niche above the portal features an octagonal rosette and a statue of the Sacred Heart. The interior of the cathedral was designed by architect Josip Vancaš, including the main altar which is made from Grisignano marble and rests on four columns of red Tyrolean marble. The frescoes were commissioned to Alexander Maximilian Seitz in 1886 but due to deteriorating health, they were only completed in 1887, and he died a year afterwards. Most of the actual work was undertaken by his assistant Alberto Rohden. A prominent feature is the grave of archbishop Stadler, the first archbishop of Vrhbosna, and the sculpture is of the hand of Marin Studin. The stained-glass windows ornamenting the cathedral were manufactured by the Viennese workshop of the Tiroler Glasmalerei (German for glass painting artisan). An English mass is held on Sundays at 12:00.

It served as a caravanserai, able to accommodate up to 300 guests, 70 horses, and offered 43 rooms where travelers could spend the night. On 29 July 1878, the inn became the scene of the protest movement against the Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia, and the People's Council (Narodni Odbor) was founded here. The building was damaged or destroyed by fires numerous times and rebuilt each time, notably in 1697 and most recently in December 1957 when the entire complex was burnt to the ground. Reconstruction took place from 1971 to 1974, and Persian calligraphic inscriptions from poems written by Omar Khayyám, a 12th-century Persian poet, were added as decorations. The property ownership to the inn was returned to the Gazi Husrev-Beg endowment in 1998, and houses a carpet shop and traditional restaurant, occasionally hosts exhibitions, and offers business space for purposes that match the historical context and purpose of the building.

The tower has a staircase with 76 wooden steps arranged in a square, and displays the time on all 4 sides. When Eugene Savoy of the Austrian army laid siege on the city in 1697 and looted it, the tower was set on fire, but restored in 1762. After the Austro-Hungarian occupation, the upper part of the tower was upgraded, and the decaying Turkish clock mechanism was replaced by a new one from Gillet & Johnston, made in London in 1873. The original clock mechanism was moved to the Vratnik mosque where it remains on display until today. The last upgrade dates from 1967, when the dials were gold-plated. A peculiarity of the clock tower is that it appears to be the only remaining clock tower in the world that displays the lunar clock (a la turca, lunar reckoning). This method of measuring time counts hours up till the moment of (astronomical) sunset instead of midnight, as with contemporary time calculation, so the hands are in the 12 o'clock position at every sunset, when a new day also begins. Since the setting of the sun is uneven throughout the year, the time needs to be manually controlled and recalibrated every 2 to 3 days. The task of recalibrating the clock was assigned to the muvekit (timekeeper), who used astronomical instruments in a special room called the muvekithana to calculate the position of the sun. The current muvekit, Mensur Zlatar, who works at a nearby jewellery shop, has been assigned the responsibility since 1960s. The exact timing of the sunset used to be an important moment for locals to schedule their time of prayer, but the original religious purpose behind the lunar time has long since had its meaning forgotten, causing many to think that the clock is simply bad at proper time keeping. In 2006, the Commission for the Preservation of National Monuments proclaimed the clock tower as a national monument of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The tower cannot be visited, but it is possible to stand at its base by following the tunnel leading to Pekara Imaret right next to the tower.","title":"Sarajevo Clock Tower","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Sarajevo_Clock_Tower_%286086843030%29.jpg/80px-Sarajevo_Clock_Tower_%286086843030%29.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Sarajevo_Clock_Tower_(6086843030).jpg"},{"description":"Iconic pseudo-Moorish revival style building in Sarajevo, constructed between 1892 and 1894 under Austro-Hungarian occupation of the city.

A secret tunnel was therefore dug between Dobrinja just north of the airport to Butmir just south: 340 m of true tunnel, plus covered trenches either side, totalling over 800 m. It enabled arms, munitions, oil and food to be brought into the city, and served as an evacuation route for officials and civilians.

It was established by Sephardic Jews during the Ottoman period, and also became the burial ground for Ashkenazi Jews after they arrived in Sarajevo in the late 19th century. It contains over 3850 tombstones and stecci, as well as four monuments dedicated to the victims of fascism. It began as a medieval necropolis of stecak tombstones, as still exist in Jablanica and elsewhere in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Sephardi of Sarajevo created tombstones with a unique morphology, of which the symbolic motifs are not found on any other Jewish monuments elsewhere in the world. The cemetery was the front line during the Bosnian War, and was used as artillery position by the Bosnian Serbs. Several tombstones were severely damaged by bullets and explosions. It was also heavily mined, but completely cleared in 1996.

According to the legend, the city's vizier Hadzi Husein had ordered to erect the bridge and embed a diamond in one of its pillars to finance future repairs. One night the diamond disappeared, and a poor young man confessed to have stolen it as a gift to a girl he fell in love with. Swayed by the love between the two and the return of the diamond, the man was released from prison, but the diamond was never embedded back into the bridge.

The oldest surviving buildings are from the mid 13th century, but the area was a royal residence from the late 11th century. The fortress is situated close to the international ferry terminal. The royal hall, Håkonshallen, (Haakon's Hall), named for King Haakon Haakonsson, was built some time between 1247 and 1261. It is used today for royal galas, as a banqueting hall for the city council, and other public events. The roof is reconstructed after a blast during World War II. The nearby Rosenkrantz tower has the same appearance as it had in the 16th century. The oldest part of the tower dates back to the 1270s, a few decades after Håkonshallen. It was expanded in the 1560s by the governor, Erik Rosenkrantz, to its present shape. The rest of the medieval buildings in the fortress have been replaced or demolished over the centuries, with some ruins still visible. Among these is the medieval cathedral, the Church of Christ, which was used for coronation and as a royal burial site in the 13th century. A memorial marks the site of the high altar. Guided tours of the royal hall and the tower start every hour between 10:00 and 16:00 every day from 15 May to 31 Aug in the royal hall. From 1 Sept to 14 May tours are only available between noon and 15:00 on Sundays. Entrance fee is kr. 40 for adults, 20 for students and free for children under 16. A small cafeteria with coffee, tea and basic snacks is open from June to August. The fortress grounds serve as a city park; you can hang out here and eat that fish you just bought at the nearby fish market - or just enjoy the sunshine and the view. The park is popular among locals and tourists, but usually not crowded. It is normally not a problem to find a good spot for your picnic or a round of Frisbee. There is a very good view of the bay. The use of open fire, including barbecues, and the drinking of alcoholic beverages are forbidden. Unlike in many other parks, the prohibition of alcohol is enforced strictly here, as the fort is still a military area with occasional military guards on patrol.","title":"Bergenhus Fortress","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Bergenhus.2.JPG/120px-Bergenhus.2.JPG","thumbnail__source":"File:Bergenhus.2.JPG"},{"description":"Between 1350 and 1750, this area used to be a Hansa dock, trading and processing area. The wooden houses at Bryggen today were built after the devastating city fire of 1702, but are probably very similar to the buildings that were there before. Despite neglect and fires (Norwegian cities had a habit of burning down because everything is made of wood), a considerable number of buildings have survived and are now listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. If you enter some of the alleyways between the storefronts, you really get a feel of what Bergen must have been like in the Middle Ages. There are a few museums on the history of Bergen and of Bryggen, but the most interesting aspect is probably that almost all of the buildings are still in use. One example is the restaurant Bryggen Tracteursted, serving food and drinks in a building first opened for this purpose in 1708. Wandering about on Bryggen is possible with a wheelchair, but getting in and out of buildings can be very difficult.","title":"Bryggen","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/Bryggen%2C_Bergen%2C_Noruega%2C_2019-09-08%2C_DD_115-117_PAN.jpg/120px-Bryggen%2C_Bergen%2C_Noruega%2C_2019-09-08%2C_DD_115-117_PAN.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Bryggen,_Bergen,_Noruega,_2019-09-08,_DD_115-117_PAN.jpg"},{"description":"The Hanseatic Museum and Schøtstuene are the only places on Bryggen where the original interior is preserved or restored.

The building was in use until the late 19th century, when it was converted into a museum. In Schøtstuene, buildings from other parts of Bryggen are rebuilt to show where people ate, celebrated and held meetings.

If you want to save a few kroner on food and drink stop by a local grocery store to pick up some ingredients to a picnic, bring along a blanket and a few beers and spend a cheap and relaxing afternoon in this park. It's highly unlikely that the police will bother you for drinking in public in this park as long as you behave. It's also one of the places where it's rather easy to get in contact with the locals. There's no public toilet here, but pop over the road to Vilvite and use their facilities for free. The upper part of the park is now rejuvenated, with a nice play area for children, occasional outdoor exhibitions and – some weekends – a café with restroom in the new Pavillion.","title":"Nygårdsparken","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Nyg%C3%A5rdsparken_ved_dam.JPG/120px-Nyg%C3%A5rdsparken_ved_dam.JPG","thumbnail__source":"File:Nygårdsparken_ved_dam.JPG"},{"description":"Stave churches are built in a distinctive style using the logs of trees as pillars, by the early Christians.

No, the water doesn't really go down the plughole the opposite way in the hemispheres, and if you want to take it seriously you won't enjoy your time here. For some of the attractions like the planetarium, the price is $7.50. You can also go to the Intiñan Solar Museum which is right next to the monument, on the other side of the north fence.

This image of the king was enhanced and revitalized by the energy of the solar star, and the deified Ramses II could take his place next to Amun Ra and Ra-Horakhty. Due to the displacement of the temple, it is widely believed that this event now occurs one day later than it used to. Also, look for a \"Kilroy was here\" on the lower legs of one of the 4 giant statues of Ramesses II, along with other graffiti, used to be considered fashionable.Guards do check for photo permits, especially in the main temple.Be sure to follow the pathway inside the fake mountain dome, to see how the mountain was constructed.","title":"Abu Simbel temples","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Egypt_adm_location_map.svg/120px-Egypt_adm_location_map.svg.png","thumbnail__source":"File:Egypt_adm_location_map.svg"}],"climate":[{"heading":"Jan","precipitation":0,"high":24,"low":9},{"heading":"Feb","precipitation":0,"high":26,"low":10},{"heading":"Mar","precipitation":0,"high":30,"low":14},{"heading":"Apr","precipitation":0,"high":35,"low":19},{"heading":"May","precipitation":0,"high":39,"low":23},{"heading":"Jun","precipitation":0,"high":41,"low":25},{"heading":"Jul","precipitation":0,"high":40,"low":25},{"heading":"Aug","precipitation":0,"high":40,"low":26},{"heading":"Sep","precipitation":0,"high":39,"low":24},{"heading":"Oct","precipitation":0,"high":36,"low":22},{"heading":"Nov","precipitation":0,"high":30,"low":16},{"heading":"Dec","precipitation":0,"high":25,"low":11}]},"Memphis (Egypt)":{"lat":29.84466667,"lon":31.25091667,"title":"Memphis","summary":"Memphis (Arabic: ممفس‎, Egyptian Arabic: ممفيس) is the English name for the present-day site of one of the great ancient capital cities of Egypt, located in and around several villages some 24 km (11 miles) south of the modern Egyptian capital of Cairo.

Unfortunately, the exhibits are overwhelmingly in Russian and Georgian, to the disadvantage of most Western visitors. But the main show requires no language—Stalin's death mask. Stalin's bronze death mask is not so exciting in and of itself, but the lighting and bizarre, personality cult-chic, red velvet display will surely elicit goose bumps. At the ticket office, ask about an English or German-speaking guide. Guided tours start regularly.

The first hospital was built in 1184-1185; it was modified several times before Soufflot designed the current building, built from 1741 to 1761. The large dome was completed in 1765. The newly built Grange Blanche hospital (today Edouard Herriot) became the main medical centre in the city in the 1930s. Hôtel-Dieu doctors were pioneers in numerous specialities, including radiology (Etienne Destot), oncology (Léon Bérard), surgery (Joseph Gensoul, Matthieu Jaboulay) and orthopedics (Louis Léopold Ollier); they contributed in making Lyon the second medical centre in the country after Paris. The building no longer fits the needs of modern medicine, therefore the hospital has been closed down in 2010. Its future is not completely clear; it should be at least partially converted into a luxury hotel and shopping mall. Hôtel-Dieu hosts the Lyon hospitals museum (Musée des Hospices civils de Lyon).","title":"Hôtel-Dieu de Lyon","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/H%C3%B4tel-Dieu.JPG/120px-H%C3%B4tel-Dieu.JPG","thumbnail__source":"File:Hôtel-Dieu.JPG"},{"description":"The largest clear square in Europe.

Sameba is a synthesis of traditional styles dominating the Georgian church architecture at various stages in history and has some Byzantine undertones. The Sameba Cathedral was erected on the Elia Hill, which rises above the left bank of the Kura River (Mtkvari) in the historic neighborhood of Avlabari in Old Tbilisi on the grounds of what was once a park, and before that the largest Armenian cemetery in Tbilisi, a tiny portion of that cemetery now forms the Armenian Pantheon. Designed in a traditional Georgian style but with an exaggerated vertical emphasis, and regarded as an eyesore by many and venerated by as many others, the Sameba Cathedral has a cruciform plan with a dome over a crossing which rests on eight columns. At the same time, the parameters of the dome are independent from the apses, imparting a more monumental look to the dome and the church in general. The dome is surmounted by a 7.5-m-tall cross covered with gold. The cathedral consists of nine chapels (chapels of the Archangels, John the Baptist, Saint Nino, Saint George, Saint Nicholas, the Twelve Apostles, and All Saints); five of them are situated in a large, underground compartment. The overall area of the cathedral, including its large narthex, is 0.5 ha and the volume it occupies is 137 m³. The interior of the church measures 56 m × 44 m, with an interior area of 2,380 m². The height of the cathedral from the ground to the top of the cross is 105.5 m. The underground chapel occupies 35,550 m³. The height is 13 m. Natural materials are used for construction. The floor is made of marble tiles and the altar will also be decorated with mosaic. The painting of the murals is being executed by a group of artists guided by Amiran Goglidze.

Aside from the altarpiece, which was painted in 1683 by order of Catholicos Nikoloz Amilakhvari, all of the remaining paintings in the church date from the 19th century.","title":"Anchiskhati Basilica","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Anchiskhati_Church%2C_Tbilisi.JPG/120px-Anchiskhati_Church%2C_Tbilisi.JPG","thumbnail__source":"File:Anchiskhati_Church,_Tbilisi.JPG"},{"description":"A copy of 11th-century Samtavisi church. The Kashveti church was constructed between 1904 and 1910 by the architect L. Bilfeldt, who based his design on the medieval Samtavisi Cathedral. The construction was sponsored by the Georgian nobility and bourgeoisie. Kashveti was built on the site of a damaged church built of brick at the request of the Amilakhvari family in 1753. Significant contributions to the current church’s ornate design were made by N. Agladze. Kashveti’s frescoes were painted by the influential Georgian painter, Lado Gudiashvili, in 1947. The name \"Kashveti\" is derived from Georgian words kva for a \"stone\" and shva \"to give birth.\" Legend has it the prominent 6th century monk David of Gareja of the Thirteen Assyrian Fathers was accused by a woman of making her a pregnant in Tbilisi. David prophesied his denial would be proved when she gave birth to a stone. She did, and the place received the name of \"kashveti.\"","title":"Kashveti Church","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Kashveti1-2.jpg/120px-Kashveti1-2.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Kashveti1-2.jpg"},{"description":"stadium","title":"Museum of Soviet Occupation (Tbilisi)","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/LocomotiveStadium.jpg/120px-LocomotiveStadium.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:LocomotiveStadium.jpg"},{"description":"Built in 1805, and later renovated.","title":"Ejmiatsin Church, Tbilisi","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/%D4%B9%D5%AB%D6%86%D5%AC%D5%AB%D5%BD%D5%AB_%D5%8D%D5%B8%D6%82%D6%80%D5%A2_%D4%B7%D5%BB%D5%B4%D5%AB%D5%A1%D5%AE%D5%AB%D5%B6_%D4%B5%D5%AF%D5%A5%D5%B2%D5%A5%D6%81%D5%AB%D5%B6.JPG/120px-%D4%B9%D5%AB%D6%86%D5%AC%D5%AB%D5%BD%D5%AB_%D5%8D%D5%B8%D6%82%D6%80%D5%A2_%D4%B7%D5%BB%D5%B4%D5%AB%D5%A1%D5%AE%D5%AB%D5%B6_%D4%B5%D5%AF%D5%A5%D5%B2%D5%A5%D6%81%D5%AB%D5%B6.JPG","thumbnail__source":"File:Թիֆլիսի_Սուրբ_Էջմիածին_Եկեղեցին.JPG"},{"description":"A 20-metre aluminium figure of a woman in Georgian national dress, erected on the Sololaki hill in 1958, Tbilisi's 1,500th birthday and designed by Elguja Amashukeli.","title":"Kartlis Deda","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/Kartlis_Deda%2C_Tbilisi.jpg/90px-Kartlis_Deda%2C_Tbilisi.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Kartlis_Deda,_Tbilisi.jpg"},{"description":"Many famous writers, and the mother of Joseph Stalin, are buried here.","title":"Mtatsminda Pantheon","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/St._David_Monastery.JPG/120px-St._David_Monastery.JPG","thumbnail__source":"File:St._David_Monastery.JPG"},{"description":"Perhaps one of the most distinctive pleasures of walking through the Old City, with its old-style balconies, ancient churches, winding streets, and charming shops.

The town is the center of the Metropolitan Region Nuremberg. Long a de facto independent \"freie Reichstadt\", the city was an early center of manufacturing and proto-industry and had a golden era during the 16th century when people like Albrecht Dürer, Hans Sachs or Martin Behaim called the city home. Annexed into Bavaria in the early 19th century, the city later came to host Germany's first railway, linking it with neighboring Fürth (this railway has since been replaced first by a tram and then by a subway line; the current route to Fürth follows a different alignment). It is probably most famous for being the site of numerous Nazi rallies and later the trials against the main war criminals. Extensively bombed as an industrial center and a symbol of Nazism, Nuremberg was rebuilt after the war and thus managed to retain much of its medieval charm.","thumbnail":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/N%C3%BCrnberg_panorama.jpg/620px-N%C3%BCrnberg_panorama.jpg","thumbnail__source":"N%C3%BCrnberg_panorama.jpg","links":[{"href":"http://www.stationsdatenbank.bayern-takt.de/","text":"Nuremberg Main Station"},{"href":"http://www.vgn.de","text":"VGN"},{"href":"https://www.bahnhof.de/bahnhof-de/N%C3%BCrnberg_Nordost-1022754","text":"Nürnberg Nordostbahnhof"},{"href":"http://www.flixbus.com","text":"Flixbus"}],"sights":[{"description":"Mostly built in the 15th century and now part of the Evangelical or Lutheran church of Germany, Lorenzkirche forms the focus of the south-side old town.

The permanent exhibition tells the story of this and subsequent trials, eg of collaborating doctors and judges, and of officers of the individual concentration camps.

The castle consists of a triangular outer enclosure reinforced with towers and bastions, which was originally protected by a deep moat and an inner enclosure rising on the NE angle and protected by a moat as well. The building phases distinguishable today on the castle provide evidence for the works carried out by each of its conquerors as repairs and provisions according to the development of military science.

This was due to the ingenuity of architect Juan de Dios Estrada, who designed the building with his memories and observations of the tremor of 1751 fresh in his mind: the building's modest height, bottom-heavy orientation, wide arches, and robust columns were intended to withstand earthquakes. La Merced was abandoned in 1829 when President Francisco Morazán expelled all clergy from what was then called the Federal Republic of Central America; the church wasn't reopened until 1853, by which time the attached monastery had fallen victim to looters who plundered its building materials for use elsewhere. Today, visitors can take in a distinctive yellow facade that has been called the most beautiful example of Spanish Baroque architecture in Antigua, pay the admission fee for the ruins of the monastery whose courtyard boasts what is reputed to be the largest fountain in Central America (the Mercedarian monks once raised fish in it), or — if you happen to be in town during semana santa (Holy Week, the week before Easter) — check out the processions that wind through the streets of old Antigua on Palm Sunday and Good Friday, beginning and ending at the church.","title":"Iglesia de La Merced, Antigua Guatemala","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/La_Merced_Church_Antigua_Guatemala_2.jpg/120px-La_Merced_Church_Antigua_Guatemala_2.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:La_Merced_Church_Antigua_Guatemala_2.jpg"},{"description":"bridge in Guatemala","title":"Arco de Santa Catalina","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/GT056-Antigua_Arch-low.jpeg/90px-GT056-Antigua_Arch-low.jpeg","thumbnail__source":"File:GT056-Antigua_Arch-low.jpeg"},{"description":"Municipality of Sacatepequez Department, Guatemala","title":"San Miguel Dueñas","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/SacatepequezGUAT.PNG/117px-SacatepequezGUAT.PNG","thumbnail__source":"File:SacatepequezGUAT.PNG"}],"climate":[]},"Aguateca":{"lat":16.41194444,"lon":-90.18833333,"title":"Aguateca","summary":"   \nAguateca is in the Peten department of the Northern Lowlands of Guatemala.","links":[],"sights":[],"climate":[],"thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Aguateca.jpg/640px-Aguateca.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Aguateca.jpg"},"Miskolc":{"lat":48.1042,"lon":20.7917,"title":"Miskolc","summary":"Miskolc, with population of about 180,000, is the third largest city in Hungary, located in the north-east of the country, east of Bükk mountains.","thumbnail":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Megyesz%C3%A9khely_-_Borsod-Aba%C3%BAj-Zempl%C3%A9n_megye_-_Miskolc.jpg/600px-Megyesz%C3%A9khely_-_Borsod-Aba%C3%BAj-Zempl%C3%A9n_megye_-_Miskolc.jpg","thumbnail__source":"Megyesz%C3%A9khely_-_Borsod-Aba%C3%BAj-Zempl%C3%A9n_megye_-_Miskolc.jpg","links":[{"href":"http://www.borsodvolan.hu/documents/szemszall/helyk.pdf","text":"Price list"},{"href":"http://www.borsodvolan.hu/vh_helyk","text":"Lines"},{"href":"http://www.borsodvolan.hu/","text":"Bus Station"},{"href":"http://elvira.mav-start.hu/elvira.dll/xslms/index?language=2","text":"Hungary State Railways"},{"href":"http://www.mav-start.hu/","text":"Tiszai Station"},{"href":"http://www.mvkzrt.hu/","text":"mvkzrt"}],"sights":[{"description":"Mindszent was a separate small settlement in the Middle Age, around 1880 united with Miskolc.

The city has an estimated metropolitan population of 21 million (2005), making it one of the world's most populous cities.","thumbnail":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Thane_Creek_and_Elephanta_Island_03-2016_-_img14_Elephanta_Caves.jpg/480px-Thane_Creek_and_Elephanta_Island_03-2016_-_img14_Elephanta_Caves.jpg","thumbnail__source":"Thane_Creek_and_Elephanta_Island_03-2016_-_img14_Elephanta_Caves.jpg","links":[{"href":"http://www.konkanrailway.com","text":"Konkan Railway"},{"href":"http://www.indianrail.gov.in/","text":"Indian railway's website"},{"href":"https://www.irctchelp.in/2018/12/mumbai-local-train-tourist-ticket-pass.html","text":"Mumbai Local Tourist Ticket"},{"href":"http://www.the-maharajas.com/","text":"Maharajas' Express"},{"href":"http://www.bestundertaking.com","text":"Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport"},{"href":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dimts.best.bestapplication","text":"BEST Prawas"},{"href":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ridlr","text":"ridlr"}],"sights":[{"description":"Precinct of the city of Mumbai","title":"South Mumbai","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Mumbai_Skyline_at_Night.jpg/120px-Mumbai_Skyline_at_Night.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Mumbai_Skyline_at_Night.jpg"},{"description":"National Park in Mumbai, India","title":"Sanjay Gandhi National Park","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Entrance_of_Sanjay_Gandhi_National_Park.JPG/120px-Entrance_of_Sanjay_Gandhi_National_Park.JPG","thumbnail__source":"File:Entrance_of_Sanjay_Gandhi_National_Park.JPG"},{"description":"Pagoda in Mumbai, India","title":"Global Vipassana Pagoda","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/GlobalVipasanaPagoda.JPG/120px-GlobalVipasanaPagoda.JPG","thumbnail__source":"File:GlobalVipasanaPagoda.JPG"},{"description":"suburb in Mumbai","title":"Chembur","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Chembur_Market.jpg/120px-Chembur_Market.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Chembur_Market.jpg"},{"description":"Shiva cave temples and UNESCO world heritage site on a Mumbai harbor island","title":"Elephanta Caves","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Elephanta_Caves_Trimurti.jpg/105px-Elephanta_Caves_Trimurti.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Elephanta_Caves_Trimurti.jpg"},{"description":"island of the Mumbai Harbour, containing historic caves","title":"Elephanta Island","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/India-Elephanta-Trees.jpg/120px-India-Elephanta-Trees.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:India-Elephanta-Trees.jpg"},{"title":"National Gallery of Modern Art, Mumbai","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/National_Gallery_of_modern_art.jpg/120px-National_Gallery_of_modern_art.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:National_Gallery_of_modern_art.jpg"}],"climate":[{"heading":"Jan","precipitation":1,"high":31,"low":16},{"heading":"Feb","precipitation":2,"high":31,"low":17},{"heading":"Mar","precipitation":0,"high":33,"low":21},{"heading":"Apr","precipitation":1,"high":33,"low":24},{"heading":"May","precipitation":13,"high":33,"low":26},{"heading":"Jun","precipitation":574,"high":32,"low":26},{"heading":"Jul","precipitation":868,"high":30,"low":25},{"heading":"Aug","precipitation":553,"high":29,"low":25},{"heading":"Sep","precipitation":306,"high":30,"low":24},{"heading":"Oct","precipitation":63,"high":33,"low":23},{"heading":"Nov","precipitation":15,"high":33,"low":21},{"heading":"Dec","precipitation":56,"high":32,"low":18}]},"Snæfellsjökull National Park":{"lat":64.8,"lon":-23.7833,"title":"Snæfellsjökull National Park","summary":"   \nSnæfellsjökull National Park is a national park located on the tip of the Snæfellsnes Peninsula in West Iceland.

It's one of six world heritage forts in Rajasthan. The name has nothing to do with the rather pretty pastel yellow colour; instead, the fort is named after the town of Amber, in turn named after the goddess Amba. The main sights within the fort include the Sheesh Mahal, adorned with thousands on thousands of mirror tiles on the walls and ceiling. The fort/palace grounds are sprawling and the information panels (Hindi/English) are somewhat limited, so it might be worth getting an audio guide or a real guide. It's a bit of a hike up from the town, and the touristy thing to do is to ride on an elephant to the top (in order to get an elephant it is better to arrive there in the morning, otherwise at midday the elephants are done working; however, the road that the elephants walk on is not so long). If you hire a genuine guide, you will be taken not only to the Amber Fort but also to the Rajasthan Kala Mandir (a government operated shop) to buy souvenirs. Guides get a 2% commission on the items you buy there. Also see the Amber Light Show below. The site has come under scrutiny as tourists claim to have witnessed the elephants being beaten by handlers. If you walk up the hill to the Jaigarh Fort be prepared to pay the entry fee as the path terminates at a ticket window and there is no way around to the road.","title":"Amer Fort","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Amber_Fort_%28%E0%A4%86%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%B0_%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BE_%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%B2%E0%A4%BE_%29.jpg/120px-Amber_Fort_%28%E0%A4%86%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%B0_%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BE_%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%B2%E0%A4%BE_%29.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Amber_Fort_(आमेर_का_किला_).jpg"},{"description":"palace","title":"Hawa Mahal","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Hawa_Mahal_2011.jpg/120px-Hawa_Mahal_2011.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Hawa_Mahal_2011.jpg"},{"description":"palace in India","title":"Jal Mahal","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Jal_Mahal_in_Man_Sagar_Lake.jpg/120px-Jal_Mahal_in_Man_Sagar_Lake.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Jal_Mahal_in_Man_Sagar_Lake.jpg"},{"title":"Ram Niwas Garden"},{"description":"observatory in Jaipur, Rajasthan,India","title":"Jantar Mantar, Jaipur","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Jantar_Mantar_at_Jaipur.jpg/120px-Jantar_Mantar_at_Jaipur.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Jantar_Mantar_at_Jaipur.jpg"}],"climate":[{"heading":"Jan","precipitation":7,"high":22,"low":8},{"heading":"Feb","precipitation":11,"high":25,"low":11},{"heading":"Mar","precipitation":3.1,"high":31,"low":16},{"heading":"Apr","precipitation":4.9,"high":37,"low":22},{"heading":"May","precipitation":18,"high":40,"low":26},{"heading":"Jun","precipitation":63,"high":39,"low":27},{"heading":"Jul","precipitation":223,"high":34,"low":26},{"heading":"Aug","precipitation":206,"high":32,"low":25},{"heading":"Sep","precipitation":66,"high":34,"low":23},{"heading":"Oct","precipitation":25,"high":34,"low":19},{"heading":"Nov","precipitation":3.9,"high":29,"low":14},{"heading":"Dec","precipitation":4.2,"high":24,"low":9}]},"Monterrico":{"lat":13.8936,"lon":-90.4819,"title":"Monterrico","summary":"Monterrico is the most popular beach in Guatemala and also the closest to Guatemala City and Antigua.
