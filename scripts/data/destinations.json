Artistic riches—the small historic quarter alone is home to dozens of experimental theaters, and diverse art galleries dot the most popular neighborhoods pressed against the dramatic Eastern Andes peaks. Culinary riches—its several dining districts play host to world-class restaurants representing all the world's cuisines, traditional and modern, frequented by the local jet set crowd. Rich with nightlife, the party lasts well into the night at sweaty salsa clubs, English pubs, caffeinated indie rock shows, cocktail lounges, steakhouses-cum-dance parties, and amidst drawn-out conversations in coffeeshops and corner cafes in this decidedly intellectual university town known as the Athens of South America. You could see the sights in a few days, or linger for a month to live the cosmopolitan life.","thumbnail":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Catedral_Primada_de_Colombia_clocktower_at_Christmas.JPG/700px-Catedral_Primada_de_Colombia_clocktower_at_Christmas.JPG","thumbnail__source":"Catedral_Primada_de_Colombia_clocktower_at_Christmas.JPG","links":[{"href":"http://www.terminaldetransporte.gov.co","text":"El Terminal de Transporte de Bogotá (Terminal Salitre)"},{"href":"http://www.terminaldetransporte.gov.co/terminales/terminal-sur/","text":"La Terminal del Sur (South Terminal)"},{"href":"http://www.terminaldetransporte.gov.co/terminales/terminal-norte/","text":"Terminal Satelite del Norte (North Terminal)"},{"href":"http://www.expresobrasilia.com","text":"Expreso Brasilia"},{"href":"http://www.copetran.com.co","text":"Copetran"},{"href":"http://www.berlinasdelfonce.com","text":"Berlinas del Fonce"},{"href":"http://www.rapidoochoa.com/","text":"Rapido Ochoa"},{"href":"http://www.empresaarauca.com.co/","text":"Empresa Arauca"},{"href":"http://www.bolivariano.com.co/","text":"Expreso Bolivariano"},{"href":"http://www.expresopalmira.com.co/","text":"Expreso Palmira"},{"href":"http://www.fronteras.com.co/","text":"Fronteras - Continental Bus"},{"href":"http://www.coomotor.com.co/","text":"Coomotor"},{"href":"https://www.turistren.com.co","text":"Turistren"},{"href":"http://www.sitp.gov.co/loader.php?lServicio=Rutas&lTipo=busqueda","text":"SITP"}],"sights":["La Candelaria","Gold Museum, Bogotá","Usaquén","Ciudad Salitre"],"climate":[{"heading":"Jan","precipitation":50,"high":20,"low":8},{"heading":"Feb","precipitation":68,"high":20,"low":8},{"heading":"Mar","precipitation":91,"high":19,"low":10},{"heading":"Apr","precipitation":135,"high":20,"low":10},{"heading":"May","precipitation":120,"high":19,"low":10},{"heading":"Jun","precipitation":54,"high":19,"low":10},{"heading":"Jul","precipitation":35,"high":19,"low":9},{"heading":"Aug","precipitation":45,"high":19,"low":9},{"heading":"Sep","precipitation":70,"high":19,"low":9},{"heading":"Oct","precipitation":137,"high":20,"low":9},{"heading":"Nov","precipitation":127,"high":20,"low":9},{"heading":"Dec","precipitation":81,"high":20,"low":8}],"description":"the capital, a cosmopolitan city 3 km (two miles) high, with some eight million people sprawling outwards from Andean mountains, where you'll find excellent museums, world-class dining, and most everything one wants from a big city.","country":"Colombia"},"Fortaleza":{"lat":-3.73057,"lon":-38.52178,"title":"Fortaleza","summary":"Fortaleza is a major city on Brazil's northeast coast, and the capital of Ceará state.

The town is the center of the Metropolitan Region Nuremberg. Long a de facto independent \"freie Reichstadt\", the city was an early center of manufacturing and proto-industry and had a golden era during the 16th century when people like Albrecht Dürer, Hans Sachs or Martin Behaim called the city home. Annexed into Bavaria in the early 19th century, the city later came to host Germany's first railway, linking it with neighboring Fürth (this railway has since been replaced first by a tram and then by a subway line; the current route to Fürth follows a different alignment). It is probably most famous for being the site of numerous Nazi rallies and later the trials against the main war criminals.

Old volcanoes ensure a dramatic natural setting, with the imposing castle atop one. Beneath its guard, the city combines medieval relics, Georgian grandeur and a powerful layer of modern life with contemporary avant-garde. Medieval palaces, Gothic churches and fascinating historical buildings rub shoulders with the best of modern architecture, such as the Houses of Scottish Parliament and the refurbished National Museum of Scotland. Variously dubbed \"Auld Reekie\" or \"Athens of the North\", but usually just plain \"Emmbruh\", it hosts great restaurants, shops, pubs, wild and mild clubs, and an unrivalled programme of city festivals throughout the year. Hogmanay, the Scottish New Year, kicks off the festivities; August sees the Tattoo, the International Festival and the Festival Fringe – the world's largest arts festival.","thumbnail":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/The_Hub%2C_seen_from_Edinburgh_Castle_%28composite%29.jpg/800px-The_Hub%2C_seen_from_Edinburgh_Castle_%28composite%29.jpg","thumbnail__source":"The_Hub%2C_seen_from_Edinburgh_Castle_%28composite%29.jpg","links":[{"href":"http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations/EDB/details.html","text":"Edinburgh Waverley Station (EDB)"},{"href":"http://www.networkrail.co.uk/aspx/807.aspx","text":"NetworkRail"},{"href":"http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/","text":"National Rail's website"},{"href":"http://www.scotrail.co.uk/","text":"ScotRail"},{"href":"http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations/GLQ/details.html","text":"Queen Street"},{"href":"http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations/GLC/details.html","text":"Glasgow Central"},{"href":"http://www.crosscountrytrains.co.uk/","text":"CrossCountry trains"},{"href":"https://www.lner.co.uk/","text":"LNER"},{"href":"http://www.virgintrains.co.uk","text":"Virgin Trains"},{"href":"http://www.sleeper.scot","text":"Caledonian Sleeper service"},{"href":"http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations/HYM/details.html","text":"Haymarket (HYM)"},{"href":"http://www.citylink.co.uk/index.php","text":"Citylink"},{"href":"http://www.nationalexpress.com/","text":"National Express"},{"href":"http://uk.megabus.com/","text":"Megabus"},{"href":"http://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/info/20088/public_transport/879/edinburgh_bus_station","text":"Edinburgh Bus Station"},{"href":"http://www.citylink.co.uk/","text":"Citylink"},{"href":"https://lothianbuses.co.uk/","text":"Lothian Buses"},{"href":"http://www.firstgroup.com/ukbus/scotland/sescot/home/","text":"First"},{"href":"https://www.lothianbuses.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Network_Map_180819.pdf","text":"Network Map"},{"href":"https://www.lothianbuses.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/City-Centre-ROUTE-map-180819.pdf","text":"City Centre Map"},{"href":"https://www.lothianbuses.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NB_Network-Map_180729.pdf","text":"Night Bus Map"},{"href":"http://lothianbuses.com/plan-a-journey/fares-and-tickets","text":"wide range of tickets"},{"href":"http://lothianbuses.com/customer-services/travelshops","text":"travel shops"},{"href":"http://lothianbuses.com/customer-services/buy-online","text":"online"},{"href":"http://www.mybustracker.co.uk/","text":"BusTracker"},{"href":"http://www.firstgroup.com/ukbus/scotland_east/journey_planning/maps/","text":"Route Maps"},{"href":"http://edinburghcoachlines.com/service-13-2/","text":"service 13"},{"href":"http://www.edinburghtour.com/","text":"sightseeing buses"}],"sights":["Edinburgh Castle","Royal Mile","Scottish Parliament","Royal Highland Show","Arthur's Seat","Calton Hill","Princes Street","Scott Monument","National Museum of Scotland","Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art","City Art Centre","Fruitmarket Gallery","Leith","Water of Leith","Pentland Hills","Loony Dook","South Queensferry","Meadowbank Stadium","Murrayfield Stadium","Musselburgh","Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway","Lake District","Northumberland","Stirling","Aberdeen","St Andrews","Blackpool","Southport"],"climate":[{"heading":"Jan","precipitation":64,"high":6,"low":1},{"heading":"Feb","precipitation":45,"high":7,"low":1},{"heading":"Mar","precipitation":52,"high":9,"low":2},{"heading":"Apr","precipitation":43,"high":11,"low":3},{"heading":"May","precipitation":49,"high":14,"low":6},{"heading":"Jun","precipitation":53,"high":17,"low":9},{"heading":"Jul","precipitation":58,"high":19,"low":11},{"heading":"Aug","precipitation":53,"high":19,"low":10},{"heading":"Sep","precipitation":62,"high":16,"low":9},{"heading":"Oct","precipitation":70,"high":13,"low":6},{"heading":"Nov","precipitation":61,"high":9,"low":3},{"heading":"Dec","precipitation":67,"high":7,"low":1}],"description":"capital of Scotland and second most-visited city in the UK.

Romania's greatest and best preserved castles and fortresses are to be found here. But for the more curious traveler, there are many small villages with old houses and fortified churches.
