San Ignacio, or Cayo as it is called, is located on the Macal river, and makes a good and affordable base for exploration of the stunning regions around it, with plenty of day trips to be taken and several decent tour guides willing to take you. It's also an important transit town en route to or from Guatemala.","thumbnail":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Windy_Hill.JPG/440px-Windy_Hill.JPG","thumbnail__source":"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Windy_Hill.JPG","links":[],"sights":[{"description":"A Mayan sacrificial burial site near San Ignacio. The site is contained entirely within a cave system, and access to the relics is gained via some 500 m (1,600 ft) of climbing over rocks, wading and swimming through water that is at times over 1.5 m (4.9 ft) deep. The cave was a sacred site for the Mayans and it contains many examples of pottery, ceramics, and stoneware, as well as several sets of human sacrificial remains, one of which (known as the \"Crystal Maiden\") has been almost entirely covered in limestone crystals by the water in the cave. The site is a 45-minute drive from San Ignacio, and, due to the caving aspect, it may only be visited when accompanied by an official guide (who will provide appropriate safety equipment) and you can't take photos inside. Most tour companies in San Ignacio are able to offer officially guided tours.","title":"Actun Tunichil Muknal","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/Actun_Tunichil_Muknal.jpg/90px-Actun_Tunichil_Muknal.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Actun_Tunichil_Muknal.jpg"},{"description":"The main attraction in the town. Cahal Pech is a smallish set of Mayan ruins that were abandoned around 800-900 AD. There is an indoor museum displaying artifacts, a site plan, and information on the ruins in a regional context. There are, allegedly, guided tours, but these are unneeded, as the site is easy to traverse. The entire site should take 1-2 hours at most for a thorough exploration. Once at the ruins, the site is fairly flat, but Cahal Pech is at the top of the hill overlooking San Ignacio. The walk uphill to it from the main town is quite exhausting and is difficult even from the San Ignacio Resort Hotel on the hill. If you have any disability, or are in poor physical condition, you will want to drive.","title":"Cahal Pech","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Cahal_Pech_Jul_10_2015_49.jpg/120px-Cahal_Pech_Jul_10_2015_49.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Cahal_Pech_Jul_10_2015_49.jpg"},{"description":"Biggest ruin in Belize, yet partially unexcavated, so you really feel like you are in a national park on a ruin.

In the top station of the cable car, there is a hotel (€30 for a double room [2013]) and a tourist agency offering various activities like horse riding, trekking, excursions, sky sports, ski etc. The area has a limited number of hotels and restaurants, but it is great for taking a breath of fresh air, mountain sports, or to just get out of the city for a while.The Pellumba Cave in the area is worth a visit.

A variety of positions were added in the 18th century, but the complex was finally disestablished as a military post in 1891 when it was superseded by a ring of forts around Namur to provide better protection against the improved range of artillery at the time. It saw battle a last time during the German invasion of World War I, after which the new fortifications took over its defensive role.

These are reminiscent of the museum in the film Planet of the Apes.","title":"Ethnological Museum, Chittagong","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/Entrance_of_Ethnological_Museum_%2803%29.jpg/120px-Entrance_of_Ethnological_Museum_%2803%29.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Entrance_of_Ethnological_Museum_(03).jpg"},{"description":"The area of Eco Park is about 996 acres (403 ha) which is established at forest side of Chandranath Hills of Sitakunda.","title":"Botanical Garden and Eco-Park, Sitakunda","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Entrance%2C_Botanical_Garden_and_Eco-Park%2C_Sitakunda_%2801%29.jpg/120px-Entrance%2C_Botanical_Garden_and_Eco-Park%2C_Sitakunda_%2801%29.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Entrance,_Botanical_Garden_and_Eco-Park,_Sitakunda_(01).jpg"},{"description":"The shipbreaking yards near the Indian Ocean are Chittagong's international claim to fame, but for the wrong reasons; these are considered one of the most polluted places on Earth with highly dangerous practices and hazardous working conditions. Greenpeace is actively campaigning against them and trying to bring this issue further into the light. Tourists are not usually welcome, but some travellers have been able to sweet-talk the gate-keeper and get amazing photos of massive ships being dismantled for parts and steel. There are many breaking yards stretching for miles, so start at one end and try your luck until you have success. Keep your wits about you, safety practices leave something to be desired. It's also wise to keep your camera hidden until you're out of view of the officials, lest you be mistaken for a journalist out to do them harm.

must see for any tourist in Baku. The complex contains the main building of the palace, Divanhane, the burial-vaults, the shah's mosque with a minaret, Seyid Yahya Bakuvi's mausoleum, a portal in the east - Murad's gate, a reservoir and the remnants of the bath-house. - The main building of the complex was started in 1411 by Shirvanshah Sheykh Ibrahim I. The two-storey building of the palace numbers about 50 different dimensions and outlines of the constructions connected with 3 narrow winding staircases. The big lancet portal directly leads from the courtyard to the second floor, into a high octahedral lodging covered with a cupola. A small, also an octagonal vestibule, located behind it, connects it with the rest of the lodgings in the palace. - Divankhana is a small stone pavilion. It is situated inside a small courtyard surrounded by a gallery-arcade on three sides. The Divankhana pavilion consists of an octahedral hall covered with a stone cupola both inside and outside. The well-proportioned high portal of the main entrance is decorated with an ornament and Arabic inscription. The ornament pictures the interlacing fig and vine leaves. The portal is also decorated with two medallions inside of which there are inscriptions in Kufic Arabic. - The Mausoleum of the Shirvanshahs is of a rectangular shape and crowned with a hexahedral cupola which is decorated from outside with multi-radial stars. The inscription on the entrance doorway indicates the purpose of the building, \"Khalilullah I, the greatest Soltan, Great Shirvanshah, the namesake of the divine prophet, the defender of the religion ordered to construct this light burial-vault for his mother and son in 839\" (1435–1436). On two drop-shaped medallions in the flannel parts of the portal there are inscriptions with the architect's name - Memar Ali (architect Ali). - The Palace Mosque (1430s) is situated in the lower court of the complex. The laconicism of its prismatic volumes, completed with two slightly pointed cupolas, is shaded by a well-proportioned vertical line of the minaret rising above in the north-eastern corner of the building. There are 2 chapels for prayers in the mosque: a hall of a large size for men and a hall of a small size for women, also a couple of small subsidiary rooms. There is an inscription laid under the stalactite belt of the minaret which reads, \"The greatest Soltan Khalilullah I ordered to build this minaret. May Allah exalt the days of his governing and reign. The year of 845\" (1441–1442). - Seyid Yahya Bakuvi's Mausoleum is situated in the southern part of the complex. Seyid Yahya Bakuvi was a royal scholar in the court of Shirvanshah Khalilullah. The Mausoleum is of an octahedral shape and covered with an octahedral marquee. It consists of ground and underground parts. The upper part of the Mausoleum served to perform the cult rites, and the lower one housed the sepulchral vault. There are three small lancet windows with a stone bar - shabaka on the southern, eastern and western verges of the Mausoleum. - The Shirvanshahs' Palace complex also includes the portal of Eastern Gates, the so-called \"Sultan Murad's Gate\" (1585). It was built within the walls of the citadel rather later than all the other constructions of the complex during Ottoman occupation of 1585-1603. The gates were named by them in honor of Sultan Murad III. - The Palace Bath-house is situated on the lowest terrace of the complex. It was discovered in 1939 and dates to 17th century. The archaeological excavations exposed a big bath-house consisting of 26 rooms. On the basis of the surviving remains of the walls of the bath-house one can say that its rooms used to be covered with cupolas and the light penetrated through the openings in the cupolas. The bath-house was semi-underground for keeping the heat in winter and the cool in summer.","title":"Palace of the Shirvanshahs","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Palace_of_Shirvanshahs_common.JPG/120px-Palace_of_Shirvanshahs_common.JPG","thumbnail__source":"File:Palace_of_Shirvanshahs_common.JPG"},{"description":"Plan of the mosque is rectangular. There is a small hall, small prayer room for women and serving rooms. The northern portal, rotated to a burial vault of Shirvanshahs is more solemn than the eastern one.

Mihrab is located in the southern end of the palace. Cupola area over one a tier women prayer room ceding to cupola of the hall with its dimensions and replacing its outlines. Aperture of the mosque’s portal is clearly described on severe background of prismatic volume, ended with two cupolas with slightly sharpening calottes. - Minaret.

A popular make-out spot with a great view and good but overpriced cafe and restaurant. Large TV and radio antennas line some of its broad peak. You can take a scenic drive through the heavily forested Mount Coot-tha Reserve to the peak to see the almost-360° views of Brisbane and the surrounding region. The mountain is 287 m (941 ft) above sea level and forms the eastern extent of the Taylor Range. It is the most northern part of Australia to record snow. It is a prominent landmark approximately 6 km (4 mi) to the west of the Brisbane central business district and is visible from much of the city. Before the Moreton Bay penal settlement, Mount Coot-tha was the home of the Turrbal Aboriginal people. Early Brisbane people called it One Tree Hill when bush at the top of the mountain was cleared except for one large eucalypt tree. The Aboriginal people of the area used to come to the mountain to collect ‘ku-ta’ (honey) that was produced by the native stingless bee. Mount Coot-tha (Place of Honey), a derivative of the indigenous term, replaced the title ‘One Tree Hill' in 1880 when the area was declared a Public Recreation Reserve. Car is the most effective way to enjoy Mount Cootha at your own pace. There is ample parking at the peak. One can also hike the marked trail from the mountain's foot. See one of the best views of Brisbane. It is best to arrive just before dusk or dawn so you can enjoy the transition from day to night. Drive to the peak for a picnic dinner and admire the views. There are several walking tracks through the forests that surround the summit; some are difficult. It is a great place from which to watch the Riverfire fireworks in Sep.","title":"Mount Coot-tha, Queensland","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Mount-Coot-tha-and-TV-Towers_QLD.jpg/120px-Mount-Coot-tha-and-TV-Towers_QLD.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Mount-Coot-tha-and-TV-Towers_QLD.jpg"},{"description":"The world's largest subtropical garden in a city centre and home to 1,800 unique species of plants.

It’s also possible to enter the old monastery attached to the side of the church and climb its bell tower.","title":"Church of Saint Michael (Olomouc)","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Olomouc_Michal_01.JPG/120px-Olomouc_Michal_01.JPG","thumbnail__source":"File:Olomouc_Michal_01.JPG"},{"description":"","title":"Olomouc Zoo","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Pohled_z_vyhl%C3%ADdkov%C3%A9_v%C4%9B%C5%BEe.jpg/120px-Pohled_z_vyhl%C3%ADdkov%C3%A9_v%C4%9B%C5%BEe.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Pohled_z_vyhlídkové_věže.jpg"}],"climate":[]},"Cocos Island National Park":{"lat":5.518889,"lon":-87.071667,"title":"Cocos Island National Park","summary":"Cocos Island is a nationally protected jungle-covered island and national park off the coast of Costa Rica.

The village, which is the world's biggest settlement on stilts, has been on the river for over one thousand years and was the capital of the Bruneian Empire. The water village people are very friendly and many open up their homes to visitors year-round. For a tour by boat, water taxis can be found by walking along the Brunei river or the main market in Bandar Seri Begawan and waving one down. Try to negotiate the price down—you shouldn't pay more than B$30 for an hour-long tour (B$15 for half an hour) of Kampong Ayer. Even though the water taxis are not wheelchair-friendly, their drivers are very willing to lend a hand and even team up and carry a person in a wheelchair on board; ask for a larger boat though.But to really experience the water village, you've got to walk around and explore it. You can take a water taxi across for $1 per person (a 2-minute ride). Ask the driver to take you to the gallery (4.884202114.9446451\n\n Kampong Ayer Cultural & Tourism Gallery), which has a detailed exhibition of the history of Kampong Ayer and some lovely artistic souvenirs for sale. The gallery is open 9AM–5PM, but closes Friday 11AM–2:30PM for Friday prayers. The observation tower next to the gallery has views of the water village and the city center. Then don't just stay at the edge of the village near the gallery – go into the village and walk around. Not many tourists seem to go in, so you may get curious hellos from residents, especially children. You'll see people going about their ordinary routines, which feels almost surreal since it's all suspended a few meters above the river. If you look around you might spot a mosque, schools, whimsically colorful buildings, and even chickens. The boardwalks might make you nervous, but there's no reason to worry – just watch your step. They're more stable than they look, and even if you did somehow lose your balance and fall in, it's just a short swim to the nearest ladder – in a way it's safer than walking next to a busy street. Don't wear high heels though.If you don't want to shell out for the ride, you can also walk into the village – start from behind the Sultan's Mosque or from the other bank in Batu Satu.","title":"Kampong Ayer","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/BN-bsb-kampong-ayer.jpg/120px-BN-bsb-kampong-ayer.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:BN-bsb-kampong-ayer.jpg"},{"title":"Istana Nurul Iman","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Istana-nurul-iman.jpg/120px-Istana-nurul-iman.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Istana-nurul-iman.jpg"},{"description":"ethnographic museum in Kota Batu, Brunei","title":"Malay Technology Museum","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/cd/Malay_technology_museum_BSB.JPG/120px-Malay_technology_museum_BSB.JPG","thumbnail__source":"File:Malay_technology_museum_BSB.JPG"}],"climate":[]},"Aalborg":{"lat":57.05,"lon":9.93,"title":"Aalborg","summary":"   \nAalborg is the largest city in North Jutland, Denmark.

Here you can enjoy the outgoing culture and natural beauty of coastal Brazil in a less dangerous place than Rio de Janeiro, Fortaleza, or Recife.","thumbnail":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/Florianopolis_downtown_night2.jpg/700px-Florianopolis_downtown_night2.jpg","thumbnail__source":"Florianopolis_downtown_night2.jpg","links":[{"href":"http://www.catarinense.net","text":"Catarinense"},{"href":"http://www.reunidas.com.br","text":"Reunidas"},{"href":"http://www.santoanjo.com.br","text":"Santo Anjo"},{"href":"http://www.eucatur.com.br/","text":"Eucatur"}],"sights":[{"description":"One of the most beautiful buildings in the city, at Praça XV de Novembro.","title":"Our Lady of Exile and St. Catherine of Alexandria Cathedral, Florianópolis","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Florianopolis_catedral_metropolitana.JPG/80px-Florianopolis_catedral_metropolitana.JPG","thumbnail__source":"File:Florianopolis_catedral_metropolitana.JPG"},{"description":"The postcard symbol of the city, inaugurated in 1926 linking the island to the mainland.","title":"Hercilio Luz Bridge","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Ponte_Herc%C3%ADlio_Luz_Florianopolis.jpg/120px-Ponte_Herc%C3%ADlio_Luz_Florianopolis.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Ponte_Hercílio_Luz_Florianopolis.jpg"},{"description":"district in Santa Catarina, Brazil","title":"Lagoa da Conceição","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Vista_da_Lagoa_da_trilha_de_Ratones.jpg/120px-Vista_da_Lagoa_da_trilha_de_Ratones.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Vista_da_Lagoa_da_trilha_de_Ratones.jpg"},{"description":"","title":"Canasvieiras","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Canasvieiras.jpg/120px-Canasvieiras.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Canasvieiras.jpg"},{"description":"","title":"Praia Brava"},{"description":"","title":"Jurerê"},{"description":"","title":"Praia dos Ingleses","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Praia_dos_Ingleses%2C_Florian%C3%B3polis_%28janeiro_2006%29.jpg/120px-Praia_dos_Ingleses%2C_Florian%C3%B3polis_%28janeiro_2006%29.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Praia_dos_Ingleses,_Florianópolis_(janeiro_2006).jpg"},{"description":"","title":"Mole Beach","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/Florianopolis_praia_mole.JPG/120px-Florianopolis_praia_mole.JPG","thumbnail__source":"File:Florianopolis_praia_mole.JPG"},{"description":"","title":"Barra da Lagoa","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Brazil_location_map.svg/120px-Brazil_location_map.svg.png","thumbnail__source":"File:Brazil_location_map.svg"},{"description":"","title":"Mozambique Beach","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Praia_de_Mo%C3%A7ambique.jpg/120px-Praia_de_Mo%C3%A7ambique.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Praia_de_Moçambique.jpg"},{"description":"","title":"Campeche, Florianópolis","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Campeche_praia.jpg/120px-Campeche_praia.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Campeche_praia.jpg"},{"description":"","title":"Praia de Naufragados","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/NaufragadosBeachFlorian%C3%B3polis.jpg/120px-NaufragadosBeachFlorian%C3%B3polis.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:NaufragadosBeachFlorianópolis.jpg"}],"climate":[]},"Rincón de la Vieja Volcano National Park":{"lat":10.83,"lon":-85.32388889,"title":"Rincón de la Vieja Volcano National Park","summary":"Rincón de la Vieja Volcano National Park (Parque Nacional Rincon de la Vieja) is a park of 14,161 hectares covering a dry tropical forest region in the provinces of Guanacaste and Alajuela , centered around the volcano, Rincón de la Vieja, and the surrounding volcanic and natural features.

This was one of the bloodiest conflicts in recorded history — some estimates put the death toll higher than for World War I, and it was certainly much worse than the American Civil War at about the same time, even though the Chinese used more primitive weapons. It was a crucial moment in China's relationship with the West, modernity, and its relationship to its own imperial history. It was partly a religious movement; the leader claimed to be God's second son, Jesus' younger brother. The quasi-Christian, peasant-led rebellion overran an area greater than Texas with Nanjing as its capital. At different times it threatened both the foreign settlements in Shanghai and the Qing government in Beijing, though it did not take either. On exhibit are documents relating to Taiping history and the grinding reduction of their movement by enterprising Qing generals and their European auxiliaries, culminating in the siege of Nanjing.

An eternal fire burns in the middle under the gold-plated dome. The Pantheon is one of the 100 Tourist Sites of Bulgaria. In order to build the Pantheon in 1977, the \"All Saints\" church in the old Rousse cemetery was demolished. The new building was open for visitors on 28 February 1978. After a public discussion in 2001, the Pantheon was \"Christianised\" by placing a cross on top of its dome.

The façade's design resembles the style of houses in Plovdiv. The frescoes at the upper floor were crafted in 1896. The exposition represents the role of Rousse as a gateway towards Europe, and the influx of European urban culture into Bulgaria at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century. Sample interior layouts are shown, of a drawing-room, a living-room, a music hall and a bedroom, with furniture from Vienna, as well as collections of urban clothing, of jewellery and other accessories, of silver cutlery and porcelain, which mark the changes present in the daily life of Rousse citizens.

The beginning of its story date back to 1278, when Henry, the abbot of Sedlec was sent to the Holy Land. On returning, he brought soil from Golgotha and sprinkled it on the ground here. As a consequence, the burial ground was considered holy and became extremely popular. In 1511 a chapel was constructed to house the bones from abolished graves. The chapel is open to the public, and contains the bones of about 40,000 people, arranged by František Rint in 1870. Rint's work includes an enormous chandelier including every bone in the body, and a crucifix style arrangement near the main altar. The ossuary is open 8am - 6pm (April - September), 9am - 5pm (October, March) and 9am - 4pm (November - February). Closed on 24th December. It is no longer closed noon-1 pm during the off season, though the nearby information center is.

More than 14,000 people were tortured here before being killed at the killing fields; only 8 prisoners made it out alive. The museum is easily accessible and a must-see for everyone interested in Cambodia's horrific past. The infamous \"skull map\" has been dismantled, although there are still skulls stacked in cabinets, implements of torture and disturbing photographs of people dying. For an introduction and further reading, try David Chandler's Voices from S-21 (ISBN 0520222474). Documentary movie S-21 can be purchased in Phnom Penh for USD1.50-2. There is also a short movie screening featuring some survivors that plays at 09:30 upstairs in the far building. A hefty slice of your Tuol Sleng entrance fee will go into the pocket of the museum's director, who is the son of the responsible government minister. (This is perhaps the main reason the museum is in rather shabby condition, and the displays so unimaginative.) And a warning to those who patronize the souvenir shop. Don't get conned into buying some vintage Rolex, Patek Philippe, or Omega watches. They are fakes and are worthless. The owner is very convincing and will tell you that it is a collection from her husband. Instead, right across from the museum (No 54 & 56, St 113, Phnom Penh is a little shop called CHA (http://www3.online.com.kh/users/wthanchashop) that sells inexpensive handmade goods that are made by women disabled from polio and land mines.

It was built in honor of the Sacred Heart of Jesus in a neo-gothic style with Romanesque Revival elements, and modeled after the Notre-Dame of Dijon. Construction of the cathedral began on 25 August 1884, under Austro-Hungarian reign, was carried out by the Viennese contractor Baron Karl Schwarz, and supervised by architect Josip Vancaš. The cathedral was the scene of peace demonstrations in fall 1991 before the Bosnian War broke out, and subsequently damaged during the Siege of Sarajevo. The design above the door to the entrance is part of the flag and seal of the Sarajevo administrative canton and the Romanesque towers are featured on the flag and coat of arms of Sarajevo, making the building a symbol of the city. The niche above the portal features an octagonal rosette and a statue of the Sacred Heart. The interior of the cathedral was designed by architect Josip Vancaš, including the main altar which is made from Grisignano marble and rests on four columns of red Tyrolean marble. The frescoes were commissioned to Alexander Maximilian Seitz in 1886 but due to deteriorating health, they were only completed in 1887, and he died a year afterwards. Most of the actual work was undertaken by his assistant Alberto Rohden. A prominent feature is the grave of archbishop Stadler, the first archbishop of Vrhbosna, and the sculpture is of the hand of Marin Studin.

It served as a caravanserai, able to accommodate up to 300 guests, 70 horses, and offered 43 rooms where travelers could spend the night. On 29 July 1878, the inn became the scene of the protest movement against the Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia, and the People's Council (Narodni Odbor) was founded here. The building was damaged or destroyed by fires numerous times and rebuilt each time, notably in 1697 and most recently in December 1957 when the entire complex was burnt to the ground. Reconstruction took place from 1971 to 1974, and Persian calligraphic inscriptions from poems written by Omar Khayyám, a 12th-century Persian poet, were added as decorations. The property ownership to the inn was returned to the Gazi Husrev-Beg endowment in 1998, and houses a carpet shop and traditional restaurant, occasionally hosts exhibitions, and offers business space for purposes that match the historical context and purpose of the building. Stairs on either side of the inner patio allow visitors to reach the first floor with the rooms.","title":"Morića Han","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Mori%C4%87a_Han_2.JPG/120px-Mori%C4%87a_Han_2.JPG","thumbnail__source":"File:Morića_Han_2.JPG"},{"description":"The clock tower, at 30 metres, is the tallest in all of Bosnia, and dates back to the 17th century when it was constructed by Gazi Husrev-beg next to the mosque that also bears his name. The tower has a staircase with 76 wooden steps arranged in a square, and displays the time on all 4 sides. When Eugene Savoy of the Austrian army laid siege on the city in 1697 and looted it, the tower was set on fire, but restored in 1762. After the Austro-Hungarian occupation, the upper part of the tower was upgraded, and the decaying Turkish clock mechanism was replaced by a new one from Gillet & Johnston, made in London in 1873. The original clock mechanism was moved to the Vratnik mosque where it remains on display until today. The last upgrade dates from 1967, when the dials were gold-plated. A peculiarity of the clock tower is that it appears to be the only remaining clock tower in the world that displays the lunar clock (a la turca, lunar reckoning). This method of measuring time counts hours up till the moment of (astronomical) sunset instead of midnight, as with contemporary time calculation, so the hands are in the 12 o'clock position at every sunset, when a new day also begins. Since the setting of the sun is uneven throughout the year, the time needs to be manually controlled and recalibrated every 2 to 3 days. The task of recalibrating the clock was assigned to the muvekit (timekeeper), who used astronomical instruments in a special room called the muvekithana to calculate the position of the sun. The current muvekit, Mensur Zlatar, who works at a nearby jewellery shop, has been assigned the responsibility since 1960s. The exact timing of the sunset used to be an important moment for locals to schedule their time of prayer, but the original religious purpose behind the lunar time has long since had its meaning forgotten, causing many to think that the clock is simply bad at proper time keeping. In 2006, the Commission for the Preservation of National Monuments proclaimed the clock tower as a national monument of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The tower cannot be visited, but it is possible to stand at its base by following the tunnel leading to Pekara Imaret right next to the tower.","title":"Sarajevo Clock Tower","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Sarajevo_Clock_Tower_%286086843030%29.jpg/80px-Sarajevo_Clock_Tower_%286086843030%29.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Sarajevo_Clock_Tower_(6086843030).jpg"},{"description":"Iconic pseudo-Moorish revival style building in Sarajevo, constructed between 1892 and 1894 under Austro-Hungarian occupation of the city.

The work was completed in 1894 by Ćiril Iveković, at a total cost of 984,000 crowns. The city hall was formally commissioned in 1896 by the City Authority which occupied the building until 1949, after it became the National and University Library of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Serb forces seized the airport, but handed it over to UN peacekeeping forces to avert international intervention. The UN used the airport to bring in humanitarian aid, but wouldn't allow any military support to the city's defenders, and they severed the city from Bosnian-controlled areas to the south. A secret tunnel was therefore dug between Dobrinja just north of the airport to Butmir just south: 340 m of true tunnel, plus covered trenches either side, totalling over 800 m. It enabled arms, munitions, oil and food to be brought into the city, and served as an evacuation route for officials and civilians. Later it was equipped with rail tracks, an oil pipe and electricity and telecoms cables. A museum has been built over the Butmir entrance, with 20 m of tunnel accessible to visitors, plus displays on the siege.

The oldest surviving buildings are from the mid 13th century, but the area was a royal residence from the late 11th century. The fortress is situated close to the international ferry terminal. The royal hall, Håkonshallen, (Haakon's Hall), named for King Haakon Haakonsson, was built some time between 1247 and 1261. It is used today for royal galas, as a banqueting hall for the city council, and other public events. The roof is reconstructed after a blast during World War II. The nearby Rosenkrantz tower has the same appearance as it had in the 16th century. The oldest part of the tower dates back to the 1270s, a few decades after Håkonshallen. It was expanded in the 1560s by the governor, Erik Rosenkrantz, to its present shape. The rest of the medieval buildings in the fortress have been replaced or demolished over the centuries, with some ruins still visible. Among these is the medieval cathedral, the Church of Christ, which was used for coronation and as a royal burial site in the 13th century. A memorial marks the site of the high altar. Guided tours of the royal hall and the tower start every hour between 10:00 and 16:00 every day from 15 May to 31 Aug in the royal hall. From 1 Sept to 14 May tours are only available between noon and 15:00 on Sundays. Entrance fee is kr. 40 for adults, 20 for students and free for children under 16. A small cafeteria with coffee, tea and basic snacks is open from June to August. The fortress grounds serve as a city park; you can hang out here and eat that fish you just bought at the nearby fish market - or just enjoy the sunshine and the view. The park is popular among locals and tourists, but usually not crowded. It is normally not a problem to find a good spot for your picnic or a round of Frisbee. There is a very good view of the bay. The use of open fire, including barbecues, and the drinking of alcoholic beverages are forbidden. Unlike in many other parks, the prohibition of alcohol is enforced strictly here, as the fort is still a military area with occasional military guards on patrol.","title":"Bergenhus Fortress","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Bergenhus.2.JPG/120px-Bergenhus.2.JPG","thumbnail__source":"File:Bergenhus.2.JPG"},{"description":"Between 1350 and 1750, this area used to be a Hansa dock, trading and processing area. The wooden houses at Bryggen today were built after the devastating city fire of 1702, but are probably very similar to the buildings that were there before. Despite neglect and fires (Norwegian cities had a habit of burning down because everything is made of wood), a considerable number of buildings have survived and are now listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. If you enter some of the alleyways between the storefronts, you really get a feel of what Bergen must have been like in the Middle Ages. There are a few museums on the history of Bergen and of Bryggen, but the most interesting aspect is probably that almost all of the buildings are still in use. One example is the restaurant Bryggen Tracteursted, serving food and drinks in a building first opened for this purpose in 1708. Wandering about on Bryggen is possible with a wheelchair, but getting in and out of buildings can be very difficult.","title":"Bryggen","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/Bryggen%2C_Bergen%2C_Noruega%2C_2019-09-08%2C_DD_115-117_PAN.jpg/120px-Bryggen%2C_Bergen%2C_Noruega%2C_2019-09-08%2C_DD_115-117_PAN.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Bryggen,_Bergen,_Noruega,_2019-09-08,_DD_115-117_PAN.jpg"},{"description":"The Hanseatic Museum and Schøtstuene are the only places on Bryggen where the original interior is preserved or restored. A tour of The Hanseatic Museum gives you a good introduction to the Hanseatic Bergen and the Hansa life, as you walk around an authentic Hanseatic merchant's house from the early 1700s. The building was in use until the late 19th century, when it was converted into a museum. In Schøtstuene, buildings from other parts of Bryggen are rebuilt to show where people ate, celebrated and held meetings. Neither the museum nor Schøtstuene is accessible for those using a wheelchair.","title":"Hanseatic Museum and Schøtstuene","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Hanseatic_museum_Murtasken_Bergen.jpg/120px-Hanseatic_museum_Murtasken_Bergen.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Hanseatic_museum_Murtasken_Bergen.jpg"},{"description":"This is a very nicely landscaped park laid out in the late 1800s after English patterns. The park is a popular picnic place for families, and in the summer there's always several groups of students and young people having barbeques. You are very welcome to step on the grass and it's a nice place to play frisbee, kubb or croquet. If you want to save a few kroner on food and drink stop by a local grocery store to pick up some ingredients to a picnic, bring along a blanket and a few beers and spend a cheap and relaxing afternoon in this park. It's highly unlikely that the police will bother you for drinking in public in this park as long as you behave. It's also one of the places where it's rather easy to get in contact with the locals. There's no public toilet here, but pop over the road to Vilvite and use their facilities for free. The upper part of the park is now rejuvenated, with a nice play area for children, occasional outdoor exhibitions and – some weekends – a café with restroom in the new Pavillion.","title":"Nygårdsparken","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Nyg%C3%A5rdsparken_ved_dam.JPG/120px-Nyg%C3%A5rdsparken_ved_dam.JPG","thumbnail__source":"File:Nygårdsparken_ved_dam.JPG"},{"description":"Stave churches are built in a distinctive style using the logs of trees as pillars, by the early Christians. This is a reconstruction of a church originally built in Fortun, by the Sognefjord, around 1150. On the 6 Jun 1992, the church was totally destroyed by arson, but a perfect copy has since been constructed. The inside of the stave church has no wall paintings and the altar is quite austere.

They are composed of a ground level construction that probably served as a funerary chapel, a deep spiral stairway and three underground levels (the lowest now flooded by groundwater) for the funeral rituals and entombment. The place was discovered in 1900 when the ground gave way under a donkey.Built as a separate (and older) catacomb, the Hall of Caracalla became linked when energetic tomb-robbers tunnelled through. It seems to have been a burial place for the Roman emperor's horses, as horse bones predominate. No, not the donkey's.The catacombs are interesting for their plan and for their decoration, as the last of the pharonic burials transitioned into Grecian and Roman styles.

Its axis was positioned by the ancient Egyptian architects in such a way that twice a year, on February and October 22, the rays of the sun would penetrate the sanctuary and illuminate the sculpture on the back wall, except for the statue of Ptah, the god connected with the Underworld, who always remained in the dark. These dates are allegedly the king's birthday and coronation day respectively, but there is no evidence to support this, though it is quite logical to assume that these dates had some relation to a great event, such as the jubilee celebrating the thirtieth anniversary of the pharaoh's rule. This image of the king was enhanced and revitalized by the energy of the solar star, and the deified Ramses II could take his place next to Amun Ra and Ra-Horakhty. Due to the displacement of the temple, it is widely believed that this event now occurs one day later than it used to. Also, look for a \"Kilroy was here\" on the lower legs of one of the 4 giant statues of Ramesses II, along with other graffiti, used to be considered fashionable.Guards do check for photo permits, especially in the main temple.Be sure to follow the pathway inside the fake mountain dome, to see how the mountain was constructed.","title":"Abu Simbel temples","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Egypt_adm_location_map.svg/120px-Egypt_adm_location_map.svg.png","thumbnail__source":"File:Egypt_adm_location_map.svg"}],"climate":[{"heading":"Jan","precipitation":0,"high":24,"low":9},{"heading":"Feb","precipitation":0,"high":26,"low":10},{"heading":"Mar","precipitation":0,"high":30,"low":14},{"heading":"Apr","precipitation":0,"high":35,"low":19},{"heading":"May","precipitation":0,"high":39,"low":23},{"heading":"Jun","precipitation":0,"high":41,"low":25},{"heading":"Jul","precipitation":0,"high":40,"low":25},{"heading":"Aug","precipitation":0,"high":40,"low":26},{"heading":"Sep","precipitation":0,"high":39,"low":24},{"heading":"Oct","precipitation":0,"high":36,"low":22},{"heading":"Nov","precipitation":0,"high":30,"low":16},{"heading":"Dec","precipitation":0,"high":25,"low":11}]},"Memphis (Egypt)":{"lat":29.84466667,"lon":31.25091667,"title":"Memphis","summary":"Memphis (Arabic: ممفس‎, Egyptian Arabic: ممفيس) is the English name for the present-day site of one of the great ancient capital cities of Egypt, located in and around several villages some 24 km (11 miles) south of the modern Egyptian capital of Cairo.

Unfortunately, the exhibits are overwhelmingly in Russian and Georgian, to the disadvantage of most Western visitors. But the main show requires no language—Stalin's death mask. Stalin's bronze death mask is not so exciting in and of itself, but the lighting and bizarre, personality cult-chic, red velvet display will surely elicit goose bumps.

The first hospital was built in 1184-1185; it was modified several times before Soufflot designed the current building, built from 1741 to 1761. The large dome was completed in 1765. The newly built Grange Blanche hospital (today Edouard Herriot) became the main medical centre in the city in the 1930s. Hôtel-Dieu doctors were pioneers in numerous specialities, including radiology (Etienne Destot), oncology (Léon Bérard), surgery (Joseph Gensoul, Matthieu Jaboulay) and orthopedics (Louis Léopold Ollier); they contributed in making Lyon the second medical centre in the country after Paris. The building no longer fits the needs of modern medicine, therefore the hospital has been closed down in 2010. Its future is not completely clear; it should be at least partially converted into a luxury hotel and shopping mall. Hôtel-Dieu hosts the Lyon hospitals museum (Musée des Hospices civils de Lyon).","title":"Hôtel-Dieu de Lyon","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/H%C3%B4tel-Dieu.JPG/120px-H%C3%B4tel-Dieu.JPG","thumbnail__source":"File:Hôtel-Dieu.JPG"},{"description":"The largest clear square in Europe.

Sameba is a synthesis of traditional styles dominating the Georgian church architecture at various stages in history and has some Byzantine undertones. The Sameba Cathedral was erected on the Elia Hill, which rises above the left bank of the Kura River (Mtkvari) in the historic neighborhood of Avlabari in Old Tbilisi on the grounds of what was once a park, and before that the largest Armenian cemetery in Tbilisi, a tiny portion of that cemetery now forms the Armenian Pantheon. Designed in a traditional Georgian style but with an exaggerated vertical emphasis, and regarded as an eyesore by many and venerated by as many others, the Sameba Cathedral has a cruciform plan with a dome over a crossing which rests on eight columns. At the same time, the parameters of the dome are independent from the apses, imparting a more monumental look to the dome and the church in general. The dome is surmounted by a 7.5-m-tall cross covered with gold. The cathedral consists of nine chapels (chapels of the Archangels, John the Baptist, Saint Nino, Saint George, Saint Nicholas, the Twelve Apostles, and All Saints); five of them are situated in a large, underground compartment. The overall area of the cathedral, including its large narthex, is 0.5 ha and the volume it occupies is 137 m³. The interior of the church measures 56 m × 44 m, with an interior area of 2,380 m². The height of the cathedral from the ground to the top of the cross is 105.5 m. The underground chapel occupies 35,550 m³. The height is 13 m. Natural materials are used for construction. The floor is made of marble tiles and the altar will also be decorated with mosaic. The painting of the murals is being executed by a group of artists guided by Amiran Goglidze.

Aside from the altarpiece, which was painted in 1683 by order of Catholicos Nikoloz Amilakhvari, all of the remaining paintings in the church date from the 19th century.","title":"Anchiskhati Basilica","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Anchiskhati_Church%2C_Tbilisi.JPG/120px-Anchiskhati_Church%2C_Tbilisi.JPG","thumbnail__source":"File:Anchiskhati_Church,_Tbilisi.JPG"},{"description":"A copy of 11th-century Samtavisi church. The Kashveti church was constructed between 1904 and 1910 by the architect L. Bilfeldt, who based his design on the medieval Samtavisi Cathedral. The construction was sponsored by the Georgian nobility and bourgeoisie. Kashveti was built on the site of a damaged church built of brick at the request of the Amilakhvari family in 1753. Significant contributions to the current church’s ornate design were made by N. Agladze. Kashveti’s frescoes were painted by the influential Georgian painter, Lado Gudiashvili, in 1947. The name \"Kashveti\" is derived from Georgian words kva for a \"stone\" and shva \"to give birth.\" Legend has it the prominent 6th century monk David of Gareja of the Thirteen Assyrian Fathers was accused by a woman of making her a pregnant in Tbilisi. David prophesied his denial would be proved when she gave birth to a stone. She did, and the place received the name of \"kashveti.\"","title":"Kashveti Church","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Kashveti1-2.jpg/120px-Kashveti1-2.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Kashveti1-2.jpg"},{"description":"stadium","title":"Museum of Soviet Occupation (Tbilisi)","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/LocomotiveStadium.jpg/120px-LocomotiveStadium.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:LocomotiveStadium.jpg"},{"description":"Built in 1805, and later renovated.","title":"Ejmiatsin Church, Tbilisi","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/%D4%B9%D5%AB%D6%86%D5%AC%D5%AB%D5%BD%D5%AB_%D5%8D%D5%B8%D6%82%D6%80%D5%A2_%D4%B7%D5%BB%D5%B4%D5%AB%D5%A1%D5%AE%D5%AB%D5%B6_%D4%B5%D5%AF%D5%A5%D5%B2%D5%A5%D6%81%D5%AB%D5%B6.JPG/120px-%D4%B9%D5%AB%D6%86%D5%AC%D5%AB%D5%BD%D5%AB_%D5%8D%D5%B8%D6%82%D6%80%D5%A2_%D4%B7%D5%BB%D5%B4%D5%AB%D5%A1%D5%AE%D5%AB%D5%B6_%D4%B5%D5%AF%D5%A5%D5%B2%D5%A5%D6%81%D5%AB%D5%B6.JPG","thumbnail__source":"File:Թիֆլիսի_Սուրբ_Էջմիածին_Եկեղեցին.JPG"},{"description":"A 20-metre aluminium figure of a woman in Georgian national dress, erected on the Sololaki hill in 1958, Tbilisi's 1,500th birthday and designed by Elguja Amashukeli.","title":"Kartlis Deda","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/Kartlis_Deda%2C_Tbilisi.jpg/90px-Kartlis_Deda%2C_Tbilisi.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Kartlis_Deda,_Tbilisi.jpg"},{"description":"Many famous writers, and the mother of Joseph Stalin, are buried here.","title":"Mtatsminda Pantheon","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/St._David_Monastery.JPG/120px-St._David_Monastery.JPG","thumbnail__source":"File:St._David_Monastery.JPG"},{"description":"Perhaps one of the most distinctive pleasures of walking through the Old City, with its old-style balconies, ancient churches, winding streets, and charming shops.

The town is the center of the Metropolitan Region Nuremberg. Long a de facto independent \"freie Reichstadt\", the city was an early center of manufacturing and proto-industry and had a golden era during the 16th century when people like Albrecht Dürer, Hans Sachs or Martin Behaim called the city home. Annexed into Bavaria in the early 19th century, the city later came to host Germany's first railway, linking it with neighboring Fürth (this railway has since been replaced first by a tram and then by a subway line; the current route to Fürth follows a different alignment). It is probably most famous for being the site of numerous Nazi rallies and later the trials against the main war criminals. Extensively bombed as an industrial center and a symbol of Nazism, Nuremberg was rebuilt after the war and thus managed to retain much of its medieval charm.","thumbnail":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/N%C3%BCrnberg_panorama.jpg/620px-N%C3%BCrnberg_panorama.jpg","thumbnail__source":"N%C3%BCrnberg_panorama.jpg","links":[{"href":"http://www.stationsdatenbank.bayern-takt.de/","text":"Nuremberg Main Station"},{"href":"http://www.vgn.de","text":"VGN"},{"href":"https://www.bahnhof.de/bahnhof-de/N%C3%BCrnberg_Nordost-1022754","text":"Nürnberg Nordostbahnhof"},{"href":"http://www.flixbus.com","text":"Flixbus"}],"sights":[{"description":"Mostly built in the 15th century and now part of the Evangelical or Lutheran church of Germany, Lorenzkirche forms the focus of the south-side old town.

The permanent exhibition tells the story of this and subsequent trials, eg of collaborating doctors and judges, and of officers of the individual concentration camps.

The castle consists of a triangular outer enclosure reinforced with towers and bastions, which was originally protected by a deep moat and an inner enclosure rising on the NE angle and protected by a moat as well. The building phases distinguishable today on the castle provide evidence for the works carried out by each of its conquerors as repairs and provisions according to the development of military science.

This was due to the ingenuity of architect Juan de Dios Estrada, who designed the building with his memories and observations of the tremor of 1751 fresh in his mind: the building's modest height, bottom-heavy orientation, wide arches, and robust columns were intended to withstand earthquakes. La Merced was abandoned in 1829 when President Francisco Morazán expelled all clergy from what was then called the Federal Republic of Central America; the church wasn't reopened until 1853, by which time the attached monastery had fallen victim to looters who plundered its building materials for use elsewhere. Today, visitors can take in a distinctive yellow facade that has been called the most beautiful example of Spanish Baroque architecture in Antigua, pay the admission fee for the ruins of the monastery whose courtyard boasts what is reputed to be the largest fountain in Central America (the Mercedarian monks once raised fish in it), or — if you happen to be in town during semana santa (Holy Week, the week before Easter) — check out the processions that wind through the streets of old Antigua on Palm Sunday and Good Friday, beginning and ending at the church.","title":"Iglesia de La Merced, Antigua Guatemala","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/La_Merced_Church_Antigua_Guatemala_2.jpg/120px-La_Merced_Church_Antigua_Guatemala_2.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:La_Merced_Church_Antigua_Guatemala_2.jpg"},{"description":"bridge in Guatemala","title":"Arco de Santa Catalina","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/GT056-Antigua_Arch-low.jpeg/90px-GT056-Antigua_Arch-low.jpeg","thumbnail__source":"File:GT056-Antigua_Arch-low.jpeg"},{"description":"Municipality of Sacatepequez Department, Guatemala","title":"San Miguel Dueñas","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/SacatepequezGUAT.PNG/117px-SacatepequezGUAT.PNG","thumbnail__source":"File:SacatepequezGUAT.PNG"}],"climate":[]},"Aguateca":{"lat":16.41194444,"lon":-90.18833333,"title":"Aguateca","summary":"   \nAguateca is in the Peten department of the Northern Lowlands of Guatemala.","links":[],"sights":[],"climate":[],"thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Aguateca.jpg/640px-Aguateca.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Aguateca.jpg"},"Miskolc":{"lat":48.1042,"lon":20.7917,"title":"Miskolc","summary":"Miskolc, with population of about 180,000, is the third largest city in Hungary, located in the north-east of the country, east of Bükk mountains.","thumbnail":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Megyesz%C3%A9khely_-_Borsod-Aba%C3%BAj-Zempl%C3%A9n_megye_-_Miskolc.jpg/600px-Megyesz%C3%A9khely_-_Borsod-Aba%C3%BAj-Zempl%C3%A9n_megye_-_Miskolc.jpg","thumbnail__source":"Megyesz%C3%A9khely_-_Borsod-Aba%C3%BAj-Zempl%C3%A9n_megye_-_Miskolc.jpg","links":[{"href":"http://www.borsodvolan.hu/documents/szemszall/helyk.pdf","text":"Price list"},{"href":"http://www.borsodvolan.hu/vh_helyk","text":"Lines"},{"href":"http://www.borsodvolan.hu/","text":"Bus Station"},{"href":"http://elvira.mav-start.hu/elvira.dll/xslms/index?language=2","text":"Hungary State Railways"},{"href":"http://www.mav-start.hu/","text":"Tiszai Station"},{"href":"http://www.mvkzrt.hu/","text":"mvkzrt"}],"sights":[{"description":"Mindszent was a separate small settlement in the Middle Age, around 1880 united with Miskolc.

The city has an estimated metropolitan population of 21 million (2005), making it one of the world's most populous cities.","thumbnail":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Thane_Creek_and_Elephanta_Island_03-2016_-_img14_Elephanta_Caves.jpg/480px-Thane_Creek_and_Elephanta_Island_03-2016_-_img14_Elephanta_Caves.jpg","thumbnail__source":"Thane_Creek_and_Elephanta_Island_03-2016_-_img14_Elephanta_Caves.jpg","links":[{"href":"http://www.konkanrailway.com","text":"Konkan Railway"},{"href":"http://www.indianrail.gov.in/","text":"Indian railway's website"},{"href":"https://www.irctchelp.in/2018/12/mumbai-local-train-tourist-ticket-pass.html","text":"Mumbai Local Tourist Ticket"},{"href":"http://www.the-maharajas.com/","text":"Maharajas' Express"},{"href":"http://www.bestundertaking.com","text":"Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport"},{"href":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dimts.best.bestapplication","text":"BEST Prawas"},{"href":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ridlr","text":"ridlr"}],"sights":[{"description":"Precinct of the city of Mumbai","title":"South Mumbai","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Mumbai_Skyline_at_Night.jpg/120px-Mumbai_Skyline_at_Night.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Mumbai_Skyline_at_Night.jpg"},{"description":"National Park in Mumbai, India","title":"Sanjay Gandhi National Park","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Entrance_of_Sanjay_Gandhi_National_Park.JPG/120px-Entrance_of_Sanjay_Gandhi_National_Park.JPG","thumbnail__source":"File:Entrance_of_Sanjay_Gandhi_National_Park.JPG"},{"description":"Pagoda in Mumbai, India","title":"Global Vipassana Pagoda","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/GlobalVipasanaPagoda.JPG/120px-GlobalVipasanaPagoda.JPG","thumbnail__source":"File:GlobalVipasanaPagoda.JPG"},{"description":"suburb in Mumbai","title":"Chembur","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Chembur_Market.jpg/120px-Chembur_Market.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Chembur_Market.jpg"},{"description":"Shiva cave temples and UNESCO world heritage site on a Mumbai harbor island","title":"Elephanta Caves","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Elephanta_Caves_Trimurti.jpg/105px-Elephanta_Caves_Trimurti.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Elephanta_Caves_Trimurti.jpg"},{"description":"island of the Mumbai Harbour, containing historic caves","title":"Elephanta Island","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/India-Elephanta-Trees.jpg/120px-India-Elephanta-Trees.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:India-Elephanta-Trees.jpg"},{"title":"National Gallery of Modern Art, Mumbai","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/National_Gallery_of_modern_art.jpg/120px-National_Gallery_of_modern_art.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:National_Gallery_of_modern_art.jpg"}],"climate":[{"heading":"Jan","precipitation":1,"high":31,"low":16},{"heading":"Feb","precipitation":2,"high":31,"low":17},{"heading":"Mar","precipitation":0,"high":33,"low":21},{"heading":"Apr","precipitation":1,"high":33,"low":24},{"heading":"May","precipitation":13,"high":33,"low":26},{"heading":"Jun","precipitation":574,"high":32,"low":26},{"heading":"Jul","precipitation":868,"high":30,"low":25},{"heading":"Aug","precipitation":553,"high":29,"low":25},{"heading":"Sep","precipitation":306,"high":30,"low":24},{"heading":"Oct","precipitation":63,"high":33,"low":23},{"heading":"Nov","precipitation":15,"high":33,"low":21},{"heading":"Dec","precipitation":56,"high":32,"low":18}]},"Snæfellsjökull National Park":{"lat":64.8,"lon":-23.7833,"title":"Snæfellsjökull National Park","summary":"   \nSnæfellsjökull National Park is a national park located on the tip of the Snæfellsnes Peninsula in West Iceland.

It's one of six world heritage forts in Rajasthan. The name has nothing to do with the rather pretty pastel yellow colour; instead, the fort is named after the town of Amber, in turn named after the goddess Amba. The main sights within the fort include the Sheesh Mahal, adorned with thousands on thousands of mirror tiles on the walls and ceiling. The fort/palace grounds are sprawling and the information panels (Hindi/English) are somewhat limited, so it might be worth getting an audio guide or a real guide. It's a bit of a hike up from the town, and the touristy thing to do is to ride on an elephant to the top (in order to get an elephant it is better to arrive there in the morning, otherwise at midday the elephants are done working; however, the road that the elephants walk on is not so long). If you hire a genuine guide, you will be taken not only to the Amber Fort but also to the Rajasthan Kala Mandir (a government operated shop) to buy souvenirs. Guides get a 2% commission on the items you buy there. Also see the Amber Light Show below. The site has come under scrutiny as tourists claim to have witnessed the elephants being beaten by handlers. If you walk up the hill to the Jaigarh Fort be prepared to pay the entry fee as the path terminates at a ticket window and there is no way around to the road.","title":"Amer Fort","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Amber_Fort_%28%E0%A4%86%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%B0_%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BE_%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%B2%E0%A4%BE_%29.jpg/120px-Amber_Fort_%28%E0%A4%86%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%B0_%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BE_%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%B2%E0%A4%BE_%29.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Amber_Fort_(आमेर_का_किला_).jpg"},{"description":"palace","title":"Hawa Mahal","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Hawa_Mahal_2011.jpg/120px-Hawa_Mahal_2011.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Hawa_Mahal_2011.jpg"},{"description":"palace in India","title":"Jal Mahal","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Jal_Mahal_in_Man_Sagar_Lake.jpg/120px-Jal_Mahal_in_Man_Sagar_Lake.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Jal_Mahal_in_Man_Sagar_Lake.jpg"},{"title":"Ram Niwas Garden"},{"description":"observatory in Jaipur, Rajasthan,India","title":"Jantar Mantar, Jaipur","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Jantar_Mantar_at_Jaipur.jpg/120px-Jantar_Mantar_at_Jaipur.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Jantar_Mantar_at_Jaipur.jpg"}],"climate":[{"heading":"Jan","precipitation":7,"high":22,"low":8},{"heading":"Feb","precipitation":11,"high":25,"low":11},{"heading":"Mar","precipitation":3.1,"high":31,"low":16},{"heading":"Apr","precipitation":4.9,"high":37,"low":22},{"heading":"May","precipitation":18,"high":40,"low":26},{"heading":"Jun","precipitation":63,"high":39,"low":27},{"heading":"Jul","precipitation":223,"high":34,"low":26},{"heading":"Aug","precipitation":206,"high":32,"low":25},{"heading":"Sep","precipitation":66,"high":34,"low":23},{"heading":"Oct","precipitation":25,"high":34,"low":19},{"heading":"Nov","precipitation":3.9,"high":29,"low":14},{"heading":"Dec","precipitation":4.2,"high":24,"low":9}]},"Monterrico":{"lat":13.8936,"lon":-90.4819,"title":"Monterrico","summary":"Monterrico is the most popular beach in Guatemala and also the closest to Guatemala City and Antigua.

Some claimed the quake was God's punishment for the evildoers of Port Royal. This disaster helped to establish Kingston as the new capital, and many of the survivors moved to Kingston.Although most of the buildings at the port today are not the original buildings, the walls of Fort Charles have been preserved since the rebuilding two years after the earthquake, Saint Peter's Church built in the early 18th century, and the ruins of Fort Rocky remain.

Women in printed chadors can go outside and playing kids are all around. Resistant walking shoes are mandatory if you want to climb up the village. A river passes through the valley, with a number of natural springs to the north of the river. Natural cones, scattered over a vast area, serve as human dwellings on rock formations which themselves seem to have been the work of sculptors. The road from Tabriz goes through this natural artwork. Large families live inside two or three of these hollow interconnected cones with features such as openings on their surface as windows. The lowest cones are used as stables and those on top as the living quarters. The interiors of the dwellings, usually divided into a living and a bed room, are dimly lit; however, the villagers are used to it. The interconnecting corridors are very narrow. From the outside, the dwellings look so similar to each other that one may easily get lost in the village. Steep pathways and steps are made of rock pieces for animals as well as human beings. As the legend goes, the first people to settle here were the soldiers involved in military operations nearly 800 years ago, who found the cones by chance and used them as their temporary camouflage and accommodation. However, among archaeologists, it is considered to be of Pre-Islamic Period.","title":"Kandovan, Osku","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Village_troglodyte_kandovan_iran.jpg/120px-Village_troglodyte_kandovan_iran.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Village_troglodyte_kandovan_iran.jpg"},{"description":"A salt lake with salt beaches and improbable bathing spots (gender separate, of course).

Once the outer pleasure gardens of the Maeda Lords, it gradually expanded to take over the entire block. While not completed in its final form until the waning years of the Edo Shogunate, it still represents one of the peaks of Japanese strolling garden design. The way in which water is piped from many kilometres upstream to fill its streams and ponds before going on to fill the castle moats is one of the great engineering feats of the Edo period. In part of the grounds, and with a steep separate ¥700 entrance fee, is the Seisonkaku Villa, built by a Maeda lord for his mother. Only part of it remains today, but is a rare example of existing daimyo palace architecture. The upper floor, with its bright blues and reds, is in distinct contrast to the muted earth tones of Kyoto style.  During cherry blossom season, entry to the park is free and it's open and lit up until 21:00. There will be many guides yelling from their electronically amplified megaphones: \"These gardens are particularly famed for their tranquility, appreciate the peace and stillness\"!","title":"Kenroku-en","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Stone_lantern_Kenrokuen.jpg/120px-Stone_lantern_Kenrokuen.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Stone_lantern_Kenrokuen.jpg"},{"description":"At the center of Kanazawa is the former site of Kanazawa Castle. It has been vacated by the national university, which took over the site once used by the Ninth Division of the Imperial Army, the castle is public space now for the first time in its 400-plus years of history. The imposing Ishikawa Gate (石川門), so named as it faced the Ishikawa district, was once a side entrance to the castle grounds, but after several fires and man-made destruction, it is one of the few original buildings left on the site, the other being the Sanjikken Nagaya (三十間長屋) storehouse near the top.

But with 23 rooms and 29 staircases, an impressive array of trapdoors and hidden rooms, and a sepukku (ritual suicide) chamber, it is easy to see why people would make that assumption. Visitors cannot enter the temple except through the tours, so call ahead to book a tour. The tour is conducted in Japanese, but they give travellers a folder with English translations. Local lore has it that there was an underground tunnel from the castle to the temple, to allow the Maeda lords an escape route in case of attack. However, no documentary proof of this has been found, and, like the ninjas, it merely adds to the myths of the place. Unfortunately, the staff have a well-deserved reputation (amongst Japanese and foreigners) for being rude and unhelpful. ¥1,000 for adults and ¥700 for primary school pupils, and you're supposed to make a reservation in advance, although they can usually squeeze you in if there's space and you don't mind waiting for your tour to begin.

A fire that occurred in 1994, resulted with an illegal opening of three shops which blocked the old entrance. Unfortunately, a hammam that once used to be a prestigious social venue for men and women, for many years looked abandoned with only few remaining walls full of rubbish, overgrown trees and wastewaters flowing inside of the building.","title":"Great Hamam of Pristina","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Prishtina_and_the_great_Hamam.jpg/120px-Prishtina_and_the_great_Hamam.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Prishtina_and_the_great_Hamam.jpg"},{"description":"This object built in honour of Sultan Murat I, who was killed in the Battle of Kosovo in 1389.

All of this comes together to form quite an interesting city.","thumbnail":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Skopje-pano.JPG/700px-Skopje-pano.JPG","thumbnail__source":"Skopje-pano.JPG","links":[{"href":"https://www.seat61.com/Greece.htm#London_to_Athens_via_Belgrade","text":"Seat61"},{"href":"http://www.sas.com.mk","text":"Bus Station"},{"href":"http://www.centralnaavtogara.bg/","text":"website, in English"},{"href":"http://www.jsp.com.mk","text":"Skopje Public Transportation Agency (Јавното сообраќајно претпријатие Скопје)"}],"sights":[{"description":"museum","title":"Museum of the Macedonian Struggle (Skopje)","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Museum_of_the_Macedonian_Struggle.jpg/120px-Museum_of_the_Macedonian_Struggle.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Museum_of_the_Macedonian_Struggle.jpg"},{"description":"Ottoman-era mosque in the Old Bazaar of Skopje, North Macedonia","title":"Mustafa Pasha Mosque","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Mezquita_Mustafa_Pasha%2C_Skopie%2C_Macedonia%2C_2014-04-17%2C_DD_62.JPG/80px-Mezquita_Mustafa_Pasha%2C_Skopie%2C_Macedonia%2C_2014-04-17%2C_DD_62.JPG","thumbnail__source":"File:Mezquita_Mustafa_Pasha,_Skopie,_Macedonia,_2014-04-17,_DD_62.JPG"},{"title":"Porta Macedonia","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/Porta_Macedonia%2C_Skopie%2C_Macedonia%2C_2014-04-16%2C_DD_105.JPG/120px-Porta_Macedonia%2C_Skopie%2C_Macedonia%2C_2014-04-16%2C_DD_105.JPG","thumbnail__source":"File:Porta_Macedonia,_Skopie,_Macedonia,_2014-04-16,_DD_105.JPG"},{"description":"canyon west of central Skopje, North Macedonia","title":"Matka Canyon","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Lake_Matka_2.jpg/120px-Lake_Matka_2.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Lake_Matka_2.jpg"},{"title":"Millennium Cross","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/%D0%9C%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%83%D0%BC%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8_%D0%BA%D1%80%D1%81%D1%82_%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D0%92%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%BD%D0%BE_%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%98_%D0%A1%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BF%D1%98%D0%B5.JPG/90px-%D0%9C%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%83%D0%BC%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8_%D0%BA%D1%80%D1%81%D1%82_%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D0%92%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%BD%D0%BE_%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%98_%D0%A1%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BF%D1%98%D0%B5.JPG","thumbnail__source":"File:Милениумски_крст_на_Водно_крај_Скопје.JPG"},{"description":"bridge in Macedonia","title":"Skopje Aqueduct","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Akvadukt_%2818%29.JPG/120px-Akvadukt_%2818%29.JPG","thumbnail__source":"File:Akvadukt_(18).JPG"},{"title":"Skopje Zoo","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Skopje_Zoo_1.jpg/120px-Skopje_Zoo_1.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Skopje_Zoo_1.jpg"}],"climate":[{"heading":"Jan","precipitation":27,"high":7,"low":0},{"heading":"Feb","precipitation":31,"high":9,"low":1},{"heading":"Mar","precipitation":32,"high":14,"low":3},{"heading":"Apr","precipitation":30,"high":19,"low":6},{"heading":"May","precipitation":29,"high":24,"low":11},{"heading":"Jun","precipitation":22,"high":28,"low":13},{"heading":"Jul","precipitation":15,"high":32,"low":15},{"heading":"Aug","precipitation":12,"high":32,"low":15},{"heading":"Sep","precipitation":18,"high":27,"low":12},{"heading":"Oct","precipitation":30,"high":21,"low":9},{"heading":"Nov","precipitation":36,"high":14,"low":4},{"heading":"Dec","precipitation":41,"high":8,"low":1}]},"Negril":{"lat":18.3110182,"lon":-78.339386,"title":"Negril","summary":"   \nNegril is a major tourist destination in Western Jamaica, known for its white sandy beaches.","thumbnail":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Redstripe.jpg/300px-Redstripe.jpg","thumbnail__source":"Redstripe.jpg","links":[],"sights":[],"climate":[]},"Banjarmasin":{"lat":-3.333,"lon":114.583,"title":"Banjarmasin","summary":"Banjarmasin is the biggest city in South Kalimantan.

It is worth putting a whole day aside (or more) for seeing these because they are a great place to relax and meet other travellers. There are multiple pools at different levels, all of which are reportedly safe to bathe in, and are extremely picturesque. Shared tuk-tuks charge about 30,000-50,000 kip (cheapest seems to be near slow boat pier, though you can get them for 40,000 kip near Joma Bakery). You may have to wait until the tuk-tuk fills up. Tuk-tuks are legally only allowed to take six people, and there is a checkpoint at the falls, so some drivers may try to get a 7th person in the front seat. Private tuk-tuk will cost you at least 150,000 kip, but you will need to bargain for some time; don't hesitate to start from 100,000 kip if the driver tells you 150,000 kip. Drivers may try to show you documents that quote 200,000 kip or more depending on driver. Just ignore this and insist. Try to go with 5 people and insist on 30,000 kip each. The driver should wait for 3-4 hours at the waterfall gate area. Make sure your 150,000 kip includes there and back. Bargain, bargain, bargain. Just remember that there are dozens of tuk-tuks around, so you have the advantage. If you lack companions, offer 30,000 kip and wait until he finds more passengers.

It's in a late 16th C palazzo designed by Vasari, in two wings enclosing a long narrow courtyard, effectively a street, an innovation in its day. Originally the palazzo was magistrates' offices (hence \"Uffizi\") and state archives; then it came to house the Medici's vast art collection. The artworks are on the first and second floors, they keep the lifts well hidden. Highlights include Birth of Venus by Boticelli, Dukes of Urbino by della Francesca, Medusa by Caravaggio, Venus of Urbino by Titian, Annunciation by da Vinci, Pope Leo X and family by Raphael, Velasquez' self-portrait, Rembrandt's final self-portrait, and many other big names. Allow three hours for a visit. Uffizi majors on Renaissance, so although later styles are represented they're few: you don't really come here for the 18th - 20th C material.

The design is distinctive: it's a three-arched bridge supporting a parade of shops supporting another bridge. It dates to 1345 (hence Ponte Vecchio, \"old bridge\"), with earlier bridges being swept away by floods, rebuilt and swept away again. At street level it's a pedestrianised cobbled arch. It's lined by shops, which were butchers until Renaissance times then - in an insight as dramatic as the discovery of perspective in painting - they realised that goldsmiths' shops paid higher rents and didn't stink; so from then to this day it's just been overpriced jewellery shops and market stalls. Above these is the higher bridge, the Vasari Corridor, a private walkway added in 1565 so that the Medici Dukes could move between Palazzo Vecchio (Town Hall) and Palazzo Pitti (their blingy residence) without mixing with common folk. On the south bank, the Corridor nowadays continues as a gallery of the Uffizi, and there is sometimes talk of extending this over the bridge, or otherwise making the space accessible. Nothing's come of this so far, so the common folk will have to continue admiring the scene from street level.","title":"Ponte Vecchio","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Ponte_vecchio_%28ovest%29_visto_dal_fiume_20.JPG/120px-Ponte_vecchio_%28ovest%29_visto_dal_fiume_20.JPG","thumbnail__source":"File:Ponte_vecchio_(ovest)_visto_dal_fiume_20.JPG"},{"description":"Contains the monumental tombs of Galileo, Michelangelo, Machiavelli, Dante, Rossini, and many other notables in addition to artistic decorations.

In another lifetime, the building was one of the city's best-known sights for an entirely different reason; designed by Czech architect Jan Letzel in 1915, the Hiroshima Prefectural Commercial Exhibition Hall (and its fanciful green dome) had a bold European style in a grimy, crowded city with few modern flourishes. Because the explosion took place almost directly above the building, the walls remained largely intact, even as the dome shattered and the people inside were killed by the heat of the blast. Initially, as the city rebuilt, it was left alone simply because it was more difficult to demolish than other remains in the area; gradually, the A-Bomb Dome became the symbol it is today. The \"Hiroshima Peace Memorial\" was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1996 amid some controversy — the United States and China both voted against the nomination for reasons related to the war.

While the towers themselves are quite interesting, it's the location and rock formations that make this hike well worth it. The trail begins above a residential area, at the \"Stone Elephant\" rock formation. The trail then steadily gets steeper and steeper. There is not a single tree to be found on the entire hike; bring water and avoid hiking during peak summer heat. With the lack of trees, it is easy to stay on the trail and not get lost. Enjoy the vistas from the trail that only get better as you climb further. The remains that can be seen are from the 10th to the 14th centuries, built under King Marko who was the last ruler in the region prior to Ottoman takeover. They exist at varying heights on the hill and are in varying conditions. Upon exploring the area, you'll likely find that you are alone in your exploration - no staff, no signs, no rules. Just yourself wandering ruins used to defend a medieval kingdom. This is a rare situation and may not always be the case, so be sure to visit Prilep soon. The fortress can also be reached by a more scenic but rough path from Varoš Monastery. You have the option of continuing on the original dirt road (before the fork) for another 5km/3.2miles towards Treskavec Monastery.","title":"Markovi Kuli","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/%D0%9C%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8_-_%D0%BA%D1%83%D0%BB%D0%B8_-_%D0%9F%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BF.JPG/120px-%D0%9C%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8_-_%D0%BA%D1%83%D0%BB%D0%B8_-_%D0%9F%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BF.JPG","thumbnail__source":"File:Маркови_-_кули_-_Прилеп.JPG"},{"description":"Built in the 12th century and set atop an outcropping of rock on Zlato Mountain, this monastery dedicated to the Holy Mother of God is renowned as a place with an incredibly beautiful Macedonian sunset. Prior to the construction of a paved road in the 2010s, Treskavec was known for being largely inaccessible but nonetheless still being home to one monk. A fire in 2013 did a lot of damage to the monastery grounds, destroying almost everything but the church. The surviving frescoes inside are from different periods in the 14th, 15th, 16th and 19th century. It is no longer possible to spend the night here as the monks' and visitors' quarters were destroyed in the fire. If you hike in summer start early, if you want to take the hike in winter, early spring or late fall, ask around to make sure the path is passable. The position of the monastery offers views below of Prilep and above of the higher distant surrounding mountains.","title":"Treskavec Monastery","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Treskavec_Monastery.jpg/120px-Treskavec_Monastery.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Treskavec_Monastery.jpg"},{"description":"Bazaar in Skopje, North Macedonia","title":"Old Bazaar, Skopje","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/%D0%9F%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B4_%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BD_%D0%A1%D1%83%D0%BB%D0%B8_%D0%90%D0%BD_%D0%B8_%D0%A1%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B0_%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BF%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0_%D1%87%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%88%D0%B8%D1%98%D0%B0.JPG/120px-%D0%9F%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B4_%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BD_%D0%A1%D1%83%D0%BB%D0%B8_%D0%90%D0%BD_%D0%B8_%D0%A1%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B0_%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BF%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0_%D1%87%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%88%D0%B8%D1%98%D0%B0.JPG","thumbnail__source":"File:Поглед_кон_Сули_Ан_и_Старата_скопска_чаршија.JPG"},{"description":"town in North Macedonia","title":"Kavadarci","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Makedonija%2C_Kavadarci_-_most_na_reci_Luda_Mara.JPG/120px-Makedonija%2C_Kavadarci_-_most_na_reci_Luda_Mara.JPG","thumbnail__source":"File:Makedonija,_Kavadarci_-_most_na_reci_Luda_Mara.JPG"},{"description":"This monastery, dedicated to the Holy Transfiguration, is 34 km (20.5 mi) northwest of Prilep on the mountainside of Dautica.

Excellent frescoes are painted on the main façade of the church under the charming porch.

The climb is enjoyable, providing scenic views of several other attractions and Mandalay. From the base of Mandalay Hill you can either climb the stairs or take a pick-up to Sutaungpyei Pagoda at the top, but the walk is probably worth it in order to catch the scenic views along the way. The climb takes about 30-45 min and requires moderate fitness, but is not overly demanding and is in the shade. Has views of Kuthodaw and Sandamuni paya, and the royal palace in the distance. Plenty of stray dogs, shops and other interesting stops (Buddhas, pagodas, viewpoints) line the path, such as the Gothama Buddha shrine. The two main south entrances are guarded by either Nats (spirit figures) or Chinthes (great mythical lions), but there are several other entrances.Along the climb from the southern stairs near the place where these pathways merge, you come across a large statue of Buddha and his kneeling disciple Ananda, who climbed this very hill two centuries before Mingdon conquered it. Buddha is seen ominously pointing towards Mandalay, indicating that after two centuries, the capital of this region would shift to Mandalay. It is this prophecy that Mingdon fulfilled.Further up, you come across a shrine showing the various stages of a man's life: birth, youth, monk, old age and death. Interestingly, there are similarities between the birth and death stage indicating the cyclical nature of life believed by Buddhism. You can see same set of figures as an image in Shwezigon Pagoda in Bagan.At the top, accessed by escalator, is the shrine to the ogress Sandamukhi on the penultimate storey. Sandamukhi is depicted as offering her cut breasts to Buddha in a scary gesture. It is said the ogress took rebirth as King Mingdon.Additional 1,000 kyat for foreigners to enter the topmost level and see the pagoda, which can be avoided by watching the sunset from the Ogress storey. However, the open four-directional view from the top storey may be worth it, apart from the access to the toilets in this area. Footwear including socks are prohibited at the pagoda, which offers nice views of Mandalay and the surrounding plains. At sunset, Sutaungpyei Pagoda crowds with tourists, and many monks and other locals climb the stairs with the hope of talking to foreigners and practicing their English.","title":"Mandalay Hill","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Mandalay_Hill_3.jpg/120px-Mandalay_Hill_3.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Mandalay_Hill_3.jpg"}],"climate":[]},"Mopti":{"lat":14.495833,"lon":-4.198611,"title":"Mopti","summary":"Mopti is one of the main ports in Mali, and a good gateway for many of the country's most impressive attractions such as Djenné, Timbuktu, and Dogon Country.","thumbnail":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Flickr_-_stringer_bel_-_Pirogue_on_the_Niger_River%2C_Mopti%2C_Mali.jpg/500px-Flickr_-_stringer_bel_-_Pirogue_on_the_Niger_River%2C_Mopti%2C_Mali.jpg","thumbnail__source":"Flickr_-_stringer_bel_-_Pirogue_on_the_Niger_River%2C_Mopti%2C_Mali.jpg","links":[],"sights":[{"description":"mosque in Mali","title":"Grand Mosque of Mopti","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/Mosque_Mopti.jpg/120px-Mosque_Mopti.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Mosque_Mopti.jpg"}],"climate":[]},"Tangier":{"lat":35.8,"lon":-5.8333,"title":"Tangier","summary":"Tangier (Ar. طنجة, Tanjah, Fr.

It is the site of the first university in Europe, opened in the 10th century and is the place where the Cyrillic alphabet was created. The church you see is largely a reconstruction of the church St Clement built when he came here and opened the university. The original portions are the church are easily distinguished from the reconstructed portions. Inside, some original tunnels are visible via plexi-glass. When St Clement established the church, just the small round chapel that today serves as the altar existed. Because of the large influx of worshipers that followed him, he enlarged the church by building the central part of the church and turning the existing church into an altar chapel. He dedicated the church to St Pantaleon (also spelled Panteleimon), the protector of health. The closed porch and the bell tower were added later in the 13th century. Before St. Clement died, he dug his own grave inside the church. During early Ottoman rule, the Turks tore the church down after a rebellion. It still attracted a large number of worshipers and pilgrims, so they built a mosque above it which stands only in ruins today.","title":"Church of Saints Clement and Panteleimon","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/2011_Ochryda%2C_Cerkiew_%C5%9Bw._Pantelejmona_%2802%29.jpg/120px-2011_Ochryda%2C_Cerkiew_%C5%9Bw._Pantelejmona_%2802%29.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:2011_Ochryda,_Cerkiew_św._Pantelejmona_(02).jpg"},{"description":"city in North Macedonia","title":"Debar","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Debar-Macedonia.JPG/120px-Debar-Macedonia.JPG","thumbnail__source":"File:Debar-Macedonia.JPG"},{"description":"city in North Macedonia","title":"Struga","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Aerial_view_of_Struga%2C_Lake_Ohrid_%26_Black_Drin_%287%29.jpg/120px-Aerial_view_of_Struga%2C_Lake_Ohrid_%26_Black_Drin_%287%29.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Aerial_view_of_Struga,_Lake_Ohrid_&_Black_Drin_(7).jpg"},{"description":"city in North Macedonia","title":"Kičevo","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Komuna-e-kercoves.png/120px-Komuna-e-kercoves.png","thumbnail__source":"File:Komuna-e-kercoves.png"},{"description":"This is the only Hellenistic theatre remaining in North Macedonia, with the three others being from Roman times.

Most visitors make this a half-day or full-day trip. With a breathtaking setting on a plateau over Ohrid Lake and Galičica mountain towering from behind, it was founded in the 905 by St. Naum, but most of the present-day church was built in the 16th century. Of the original church, just the side chapel with the grave of St. Naum still stands. In the side chamber, visitors typically get down on their knees and try to listen for the heartbeat of St. Naum on his resting place. The frescoes were painted in 1806 (the side chapel frescoes depict the life and miracles of St. Naum); in the first chamber of the church look for the fresco of Sts. Cyril and Methodius and their students including St. Clement and St. Naum. The icon screen was made in 1711 and it is the oldest completely preserved wooden high icon screen in the country. Around the monastery grounds look for the peacocks, including rare albino ones. Parts of the dormitories of the monastery have been turned into a guest lodging. Near the monastery is a chapel dedicated to St Petka with holy water and beside it are the springs of the Black Drim River. Next to the monastery, the river enters the lake. On both sides of the monastery there are pleasant sandy beaches, packed in summertime. At the entrance from the parking lot to the sprawling monastery grounds is a promenade with souvenir shops and restaurants.","title":"Monastery of Saint Naum","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Saint_Naum_Monastery_%28%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%80_%D0%A1%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B8_%D0%9D%D0%B0%D1%83%D0%BC_%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B4_%D0%9E%D1%85%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B4%D0%B0%2C_%D0%9C%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%98%D0%B0%29.jpg/120px-Saint_Naum_Monastery_%28%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%80_%D0%A1%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B8_%D0%9D%D0%B0%D1%83%D0%BC_%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B4_%D0%9E%D1%85%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B4%D0%B0%2C_%D0%9C%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%98%D0%B0%29.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Saint_Naum_Monastery_(манастир_Свети_Наум_код_Охрида,_Македонија).jpg"}],"climate":[]},"Redang":{"lat":5.775,"lon":103.015,"title":"Redang","summary":"   \nRedang Island (Malay: Pulau Redang) is an island in Kuala Nerus District, Terengganu, Malaysia.

You then visit the 9th Fort and the 32m high memorial to the victims; the fort tunnels can only be seen by special tour.","title":"Kaunas Fortress","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/Kauno_tvirtove.Kaunas_Fortress.jpg/120px-Kauno_tvirtove.Kaunas_Fortress.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Kauno_tvirtove.Kaunas_Fortress.jpg"},{"title":"Napoleon's Hill","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Jiesios_piliakalnis_i%C5%A1_kito_Nemuno_up%C4%97s_kranto.jpg/120px-Jiesios_piliakalnis_i%C5%A1_kito_Nemuno_up%C4%97s_kranto.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Jiesios_piliakalnis_iš_kito_Nemuno_upės_kranto.jpg"},{"description":"reservoir in Lithuania","title":"Kaunas Reservoir","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Lithuania_Kaunas_yacht_club.jpg/120px-Lithuania_Kaunas_yacht_club.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Lithuania_Kaunas_yacht_club.jpg"},{"title":"Kruonis Pumped Storage Plant","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/Kruonis_Pumped_Storage_Plant.jpg/120px-Kruonis_Pumped_Storage_Plant.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Kruonis_Pumped_Storage_Plant.jpg"},{"title":"Kaunas State Drama Theatre","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Kaunas_drama_theatre.jpg/90px-Kaunas_drama_theatre.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Kaunas_drama_theatre.jpg"},{"description":"arena","title":"Kaunas Sports Hall","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Kauno_sporto_hale.jpg/120px-Kauno_sporto_hale.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Kauno_sporto_hale.jpg"},{"description":"dam in Lithuania","title":"Kaunas Hydroelectric Power Plant","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Kauno_hidroelektrine_2006-06-03.jpg/120px-Kauno_hidroelektrine_2006-06-03.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Kauno_hidroelektrine_2006-06-03.jpg"}],"climate":[{"heading":"Jan","precipitation":39,"high":null,"low":null},{"heading":"Feb","precipitation":31,"high":null,"low":null},{"heading":"Mar","precipitation":35,"high":3,"low":null},{"heading":"Apr","precipitation":42,"high":11,"low":2},{"heading":"May","precipitation":55,"high":18,"low":7},{"heading":"Jun","precipitation":69,"high":21,"low":11},{"heading":"Jul","precipitation":80,"high":22,"low":13},{"heading":"Aug","precipitation":78,"high":22,"low":12},{"heading":"Sep","precipitation":56,"high":17,"low":8},{"heading":"Oct","precipitation":45,"high":11,"low":4},{"heading":"Nov","precipitation":53,"high":4,"low":null},{"heading":"Dec","precipitation":47,"high":0,"low":null}]},"Rotterdam":{"lat":51.9239,"lon":4.4623,"title":"Rotterdam","summary":"Rotterdam is a city in the province of South Holland in the west of the Netherlands.

The adjoining Zaharah Botanical Garden lies about 300 m northwest of the palace museum complex centred about a roundabout. The palace complex was first completed in 1866 but has been extended and refurbished many times since. It was built in the neoclassical style by local artisans under the supervision of a European architect. The original furniture of the palace was made in England and ordered by Sultan Abu Bakar in 1866.

At one point he learned of a plot to poison the British officers, hanged all the cooks, then calmly proceeded to dinner.During the Mutiny of 1857 Nicholson planned a bold attack on Delhi, and bullied the aged and conservative General in charge into approving it. He was shot while leading the attack and died a few days later, aged 35, but the British took Delhi and ended the mutiny. The British considered him a major hero, and some of the natives (much to his dismay) treated him as a rather odd sort of saint, creating a cult of \"Nikal Seyn\" which lasted well into the 20th century. His tomb is in Delhi and there are statues in both Delhi and Ireland, but this monument is on the frontier where he spent most of his career.","title":"Nicholson's Obelisk","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Nicholsons_Monument.jpg/120px-Nicholsons_Monument.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Nicholsons_Monument.jpg"}],"climate":[]},"El Castillo":{"lat":11.033333,"lon":-84.466667,"title":"El Castillo","summary":"   \nEl Castillo is a town in Rio San Juan department of Nicaragua.","thumbnail":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/El_castillo_streetscene.jpg/440px-El_castillo_streetscene.jpg","thumbnail__source":"El_castillo_streetscene.jpg","links":[],"sights":[],"climate":[]},"Jenin":{"lat":32.46666667,"lon":35.3,"title":"Jenin","summary":"   \nJenin is a 4,000-year-old city in the north West Bank now populated by Palestinians.","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Building_in_construction_in_Jenin%2C_West_Bank_028_-_Aug_2011.jpg/400px-Building_in_construction_in_Jenin%2C_West_Bank_028_-_Aug_2011.jpg","thumbnail__source":"./File:Building_in_construction_in_Jenin,_West_Bank_028_-_Aug_2011.jpg","links":[],"sights":[{"description":"Palestinian city","title":"Jenin","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Palestine_location_map_wide.png/64px-Palestine_location_map_wide.png","thumbnail__source":"File:Palestine_location_map_wide.png"},{"description":"part of the Palestinian territories near the Mediterranean coast of Western Asia","title":"West Bank","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/We-map.png/55px-We-map.png","thumbnail__source":"File:We-map.png"},{"description":"A theatre in the refugee camp hosting a large variety of plays and productions, many concerning the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Gerasimus left his family wealth and worldly affairs to become a monk. He departed for the region Thebaid in the Egyptian desert, later again returning to his native Lycia. About the middle of 5th century Saint Gerasimus went to Palestine and settled in wilderness near the Jordan River. There he established a monastery and became known for his righteous life of asceticism and prayer. The story of Gerasimus and the lion, when the saint tamed the animal by removing a thorn from its paw and taught it obedience, became widely known in the Christian world. He is reputed to have attended to the Fourth Ecumenical Council at Chalcedon in 451.The history of the monastery is also linked to another Christian narrative.

It is one of the oldest churches in the world, and has been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. The first incarnation of the building was erected on the orders of the Roman Emperor Constantine I (the Great) in 330 CE. While the layout largely corresponds to Emperor Justinian's plans from 540 CE (the first building having been destroyed in a 536 riot), the church was first heavily fortified by the Crusaders and then degraded (mostly through neglect) under Mamluk rule. An earthquake in 1834 and a fire in 1869 didn't help. Today, the structure is mostly sound but somewhat dark and gloomy in appearance, only the adjoining Franciscan Church of St Catherine (dated 1881 and the site of the yearly December 24 midnight mass broadcast around the world) being in excellent shape. The alleged site of Jesus' birth is actually in an cave in the church (the original Manger where Jesus was born was a cave, not a shed, as popularly depicted). There is a star marking the exact location of Jesus' birth in the cave. The original Manger with the star marking Jesus' birth site is called the Grotto of the Nativity, and is accessible from inside the church. (The tomb of famed theologian and Bethlehem resident St. Jerome, who spent his life translating the Bible, is also in the cave with the Grotto.) Entrance to the entire complex is free, but in the high season (and especially on Jan 6th) be prepared for massive crowds and hour-long waits for entry into the Grotto. There are usually accredited but dodgy tour-guides waiting at the entrance or inside of the church who offer to give tours to groups/individuals, sometimes allowing you to skip the crowds. Makes sure to agree on a price before taking the tour, and if the promise was to skip the crowds and get into the crotto directly but not possible sometimes, lower the price by at least half. Otherwise do not support them, as it is unfair to the other visitors waiting.","title":"Church of the Nativity","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Church_of_the_Nativity_%287703592746%29.jpg/120px-Church_of_the_Nativity_%287703592746%29.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Church_of_the_Nativity_(7703592746).jpg"},{"description":"Where Mary supposedly spilled a few drops of breast milk while feeding Jesus as she hid before the Holy Family's escape to Egypt, turning the cavern milky white.

The island has interesting colonial architecture, mostly in ruins, including the landmark \"House of Slaves\" museum. Ferries can be taken from the terminal north of Place de l'Independence and cost CFA5000. The trip takes 10-20 minutes. There are many small restaurants and a handful of places offering lodging. This is a place with a great atmosphere, because it gives you kind of an pirate-island (with friendly folks all-over kind of feeling). Just walk around and explore. It's a small island, so you can easily stroll around it in an hour. You can buy cheap beer and lounge on the beach when you're done, or stroll some more and buy art-work from the locals.","title":"Gorée","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Senegal_isola_di_Gor%C3%A8.jpg/120px-Senegal_isola_di_Gor%C3%A8.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Senegal_isola_di_Gorè.jpg"},{"description":"The Western tip of the African continent where plenty of seafood restaurants are located.","title":"Pointe des Almadies","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Pointe_des_Almadies_-_Senegal.jpg/120px-Pointe_des_Almadies_-_Senegal.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Pointe_des_Almadies_-_Senegal.jpg"},{"description":"","title":"Our Lady of Victories Cathedral, Dakar","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Dakar_cathedrale.jpg/120px-Dakar_cathedrale.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Dakar_cathedrale.jpg"},{"description":"building in Senegal","title":"Grand Mosque of Dakar","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/DakarGrandeMosqu%C3%A9e.jpg/120px-DakarGrandeMosqu%C3%A9e.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:DakarGrandeMosquée.jpg"},{"description":"lake in Senegal","title":"Lake Retba","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/LacRose1.jpg/120px-LacRose1.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:LacRose1.jpg"}],"climate":[{"heading":"Jan","precipitation":2.1,"high":25,"low":17},{"heading":"Feb","precipitation":1.3,"high":25,"low":17},{"heading":"Mar","precipitation":0,"high":25,"low":17},{"heading":"Apr","precipitation":0,"high":25,"low":18},{"heading":"May","precipitation":0,"high":26,"low":20},{"heading":"Jun","precipitation":10,"high":29,"low":23},{"heading":"Jul","precipitation":83,"high":30,"low":25},{"heading":"Aug","precipitation":184,"high":30,"low":25},{"heading":"Sep","precipitation":157,"high":30,"low":24},{"heading":"Oct","precipitation":52,"high":30,"low":24},{"heading":"Nov","precipitation":2.6,"high":29,"low":23},{"heading":"Dec","precipitation":2.6,"high":27,"low":20}]},"Lima":{"lat":-12.043333,"lon":-77.028333,"title":"Lima","summary":"Lima is the capital of Peru and its largest city.","thumbnail":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/LIM_terminal.jpg/440px-LIM_terminal.jpg","thumbnail__source":"LIM_terminal.jpg","links":[{"href":"https://www.airportexpresslima.com/","text":"Airport Express Lima"},{"href":"http://granterminalterrestre.com/servicios.","text":"Gran Terminal Terrestre Plaza Norte"},{"href":"http://granterminalterrestre.com/servicios","text":"Gran Terminal Terrestre Plaza Norte"}],"sights":[{"description":"district of Lima, Peru","title":"Santiago de Surco","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Lica-surco.png/75px-Lica-surco.png","thumbnail__source":"File:Lica-surco.png"},{"description":"district of Lima, Peru","title":"Pueblo Libre","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Plaza_Principal_de_Pueblo_Libre.JPG/120px-Plaza_Principal_de_Pueblo_Libre.JPG","thumbnail__source":"File:Plaza_Principal_de_Pueblo_Libre.JPG"},{"description":"cultural heritage site in Peru","title":"Lima Art Museum","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Fachada_del_Museo_de_Arte_de_Lima_-_Por_Nina_Gavancho.jpg/120px-Fachada_del_Museo_de_Arte_de_Lima_-_Por_Nina_Gavancho.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Fachada_del_Museo_de_Arte_de_Lima_-_Por_Nina_Gavancho.jpg"}],"climate":[{"heading":"Jan","precipitation":0.1,"high":30,"low":20},{"heading":"Feb","precipitation":0.1,"high":32,"low":23},{"heading":"Mar","precipitation":4.1,"high":33,"low":25},{"heading":"Apr","precipitation":0,"high":27,"low":20},{"heading":"May","precipitation":0.1,"high":25,"low":19},{"heading":"Jun","precipitation":0.2,"high":23,"low":18},{"heading":"Jul","precipitation":0.9,"high":20,"low":11},{"heading":"Aug","precipitation":0.8,"high":22,"low":15},{"heading":"Sep","precipitation":0.6,"high":24,"low":17},{"heading":"Oct","precipitation":0.2,"high":26,"low":17},{"heading":"Nov","precipitation":0,"high":28,"low":18},{"heading":"Dec","precipitation":0.3,"high":29,"low":18}]},"Sochi":{"lat":43.596,"lon":39.726,"title":"Sochi","summary":"   \nSochi (Russian: Cо́чи, SO-chee) is one of the southernmost places of Russia and the second-largest city of Krasnodar Krai, with a population of 415,000.

The castle is a relic of the Hunyadi dynasty. In the 14th century, the castle was given to John Hunyadi Serb, or Sorb by Sigismund King of Hungary as severance. The castle was restored between 1446 and 1453 by his grandson John Hunyadi. It was built mainly in Gothic style, but has Renaissance architectural elements. It features tall and strong defense towers, an interior yard and a drawbridge. Built over the site of an older fortification and on a rock above the small river Zlasti, the castle is a large and imposing building with tall and diversely colored roofs, towers and myriad windows and balconies adorned with stone carvings. As one of the most important properties of John Hunyadi, the castle was transformed during his reign. It became a sumptuous home, not only a strategically enforced point. With the passing of the years, the masters of the castle had modified its look, adding towers, halls and guest rooms. The gallery and the keep - the last defense tower (called Ne boisa = Do not be afraid), which remained unchanged from Iancu de Hunedoara's time, and the Capistrano Tower (named after the Franciscan monk from the castle court) are some of the most significant parts of the construction. Other significant parts of the building are the Knights' Hall (a great reception hall), the Club Tower, the White bastion, which served as a food storage room, and the Diet Hall, on whose walls medallions are painted (among them there are the portraits of Matei Basarab, ruler from Wallachia, and Vasile Lupu, ruler of Moldavia). In the wing of the castle called the Mantle, a painting can be seen which portrays the legend of the raven from which the name of the descendants of John Hunyadi, Corvinus came. In the castle yard, near the chapel built also during Vlad The Third's ruling, is a well 30 meters deep. The legend says that this fountain was dug by twelve Turkish prisoners to whom liberty was promised if they reached water. After 15 years they completed the well, but their captors did not keep their promise. It is said that the inscription on a wall of the well means \"you have water, but not soul\". Specialists, however, have translated the inscription as \"he who wrote this inscription is Hasan, who lives as slave of the giaours, in the fortress near the church\".","title":"Corvin Castle","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Hunedoara_castle.jpg/120px-Hunedoara_castle.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Hunedoara_castle.jpg"},{"description":"It was the second industrial blast furnace in the world used for the extraction of iron.

The statue was presented by Ferdinand Magellan to Queen Juana during the baptism of King Humabon and his wife Queen Juana on 14 April 1521. The natives of Cebu were formally Christianized by Miguel Lopez de Legaspi and Father Andres de Urdaneta on 27 April 1565. However, as they found the natives hostile, the village was set on fire. Later on, in a burnt-out house, a soldier named Juan Camus found the statue untouched. This was proclaimed a miracle. The statue, adorned with gold and precious stones, is in a glass case to the left of the altar. The church sees a constant stream of devotees praying at pews in the sanctuary and in front of statues of saints. The Basilica del Santo Niño Museum (open Tu-Su 8-11:45AM, 1:30-4:45PM) contains the vestments used to dress the Santo Niño and jewellery offered to the Santo Niño for use during his feast (#Sinolog) on the third Sunday of January.","title":"Basilica del Santo Niño","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Basilica_del_Santo_Nino_in_Cebu.jpg/120px-Basilica_del_Santo_Nino_in_Cebu.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Basilica_del_Santo_Nino_in_Cebu.jpg"},{"description":"An octagonal building decorated with murals containing a large wooden cross that commemorates the Portuguese conquistador Ferdinand Magellan who planted a wooden cross upon converting the original inhabitants to Christianity.

Asunción is nonetheless a thriving city with an important commercial activity, a rich cultural scene with interesting museums, theaters and art galleries, an active nightlife and some excellent hotels and restaurants.","thumbnail":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Fernandooo2.jpg/600px-Fernandooo2.jpg","thumbnail__source":"Fernandooo2.jpg","links":[{"href":"http://toa.asuncion.gov.py","text":"Terminal de Omnibus de Asunción"},{"href":"https://www.facebook.com/copanatra/","text":"Copanatra"},{"href":"https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=18/-25.28921/-57.62718","text":"OpenStreetMap"},{"href":"https://www.facebook.com/catamaranaguasdeparaguay/","text":"Aguas del Paraguay"}],"sights":[{"description":"official residence of the President of Paraguay","title":"Mburuvicha Róga","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Mburuvicha_R%C3%B3ga_Asunci%C3%B3n_Paraguay.jpg/120px-Mburuvicha_R%C3%B3ga_Asunci%C3%B3n_Paraguay.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Mburuvicha_Róga_Asunción_Paraguay.jpg"},{"description":"One of the few museums that open on weekends it's in an old colonial building that was the Congress Palace until 2003.

Although this effect is unproven in its pure form, the Guggenheim nevertheless changed the world wide perception of Bilbao. The graceful, sensuous curves, evocative of the ships that used to be ubiquitous along the docks of Bilbao, are covered in titanium squares, which resemble the scales of a fish and shimmer in the sunlight. In keeping with the maritime theme, appropriate for the setting, the skylights of the largest gallery (formerly known as the Fish gallery) are designed to look like the fins of fish. Many parts of the building are purely decorative, and don't serve any purpose.

An underground passage, reopened when the Museum was created, connects the two buildings. The archeological tour beneath the cathedral is excellent for archeology fans it explains the origins not only of the cathedral but the reason for Geneva's location back to pre-Roman times. Those willing to climb the steps of the Cathedral's towers will be rewarded with magnificent views of Geneva and the lake. Nearby, the Auditoire, where Calvin taught, completes a complex that is both representative of the past and open to current questions. The new Espace Saint-Pierre thus aims to contribute to our understanding of today’s world – between tradition and modernity, cultural experimentation and spiritual practice. These three buildings invite the visitor to explore the city’s history. Religious denominations aside, Espace Saint Pierre represents a spirit that continues to guide the city and citizens of Geneva today.

The second plan of the cathedral was designed by Ivan Starov, a famous Russian architect from St. Petersburg and approved by Catherine the Great in 1792. Building of the cathedral was completed only during the reign of Nicholas I of Russia (Catherine’s grandson) in 1835.

In 1975 – 1988 the cathedral functioned as the museum of religion and atheism. Nowadays it functions as a cathedral and is open to public.

The settlement dates back to the 7th century BC and is considered as the first proof of agriculture in Central Asia. The excavations at Jeitun show that the Neolithic revolution in Central Asia took place almost simultaneously with similar developments in Western Asia. Jeitun was excavated from 1957 onwards by the Russian archaeologist V.M.vMasson. Jeitun covers an area of about 5,000 m². It consists of free-standing houses of an uniform ground plan. The houses were rectangular and had a large fireplace on one side, a niche facing it, and adjacent yard areas. The floors were covered with lime plaster. The buildings were made of cylindrical clay blocks about 70 cm long and 20 cm thick. The clay was mixed with finely chopped straw. The settlement consisted of 30 to 35 single room houses. Each house is considered as home for 5 to 6 people. 160-200 people could live here at the same time. They formed a tribal settlement and their economy seems to have been communal, not individual. The people of the Jeitun culture were growing barley and two sorts of wheat, which were harvested with wooden or bone knives or sickles with stone blades. At Jeitun blades were found in every house. It can be assumed that almost the entire population participated in farming. The settlement of Jeitun was built of houses of one room only with an area of 15-30 m². Each house had only one fireplace, it was designed for a single family and not for collective meals. The same layout designed for a nuclear family has been found in other settlements of Western Asia as well. The fact that the Neolithic settlements consisted of about 30 houses one room reveals the tendency of the nuclear families to form larger units because of the economic necessity that arose from partial use of irrigation. The society of Jeitun was thus formed of nuclear families living in kinship settlements that formed small tribes.","title":"Jeitun","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Relief_Map_of_Turkmenistan.png/120px-Relief_Map_of_Turkmenistan.png","thumbnail__source":"File:Relief_Map_of_Turkmenistan.png"},{"title":"Altyn Asyr bazaar","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Tolkuchka_Bazaar_in_Ashgabat.jpg/120px-Tolkuchka_Bazaar_in_Ashgabat.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Tolkuchka_Bazaar_in_Ashgabat.jpg"}],"climate":[{"heading":"Jan","precipitation":0,"high":7,"low":null},{"heading":"Feb","precipitation":0,"high":10,"low":0},{"heading":"Mar","precipitation":0,"high":15,"low":5},{"heading":"Apr","precipitation":0,"high":24,"low":11},{"heading":"May","precipitation":0,"high":30,"low":16},{"heading":"Jun","precipitation":0,"high":36,"low":21},{"heading":"Jul","precipitation":0,"high":38,"low":23},{"heading":"Aug","precipitation":0,"high":37,"low":21},{"heading":"Sep","precipitation":0,"high":32,"low":10},{"heading":"Oct","precipitation":0,"high":23,"low":7},{"heading":"Nov","precipitation":0,"high":17,"low":5},{"heading":"Dec","precipitation":0,"high":10,"low":3}]},"Anau":{"lat":37.8833,"lon":58.5333,"title":"Anau","summary":"   \nAnau (Anew) is a city in Ahal Province, Turkmenistan.","thumbnail":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Anau_Mishin.jpg/500px-Anau_Mishin.jpg","thumbnail__source":"Anau_Mishin.jpg","links":[],"sights":[],"climate":[]},"Antalya":{"lat":36.9,"lon":30.6833,"title":"Antalya","summary":"Antalya is the largest city on the Turkish Mediterranean coast, and is one of the hubs of the so-called Turkish Riviera.","thumbnail":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/Antalya_Hafen.jpg/700px-Antalya_Hafen.jpg","thumbnail__source":"Antalya_Hafen.jpg","links":[{"href":"http://www.otobusbileti.gen.tr/antalya-otobus-bileti","text":"otobusbileti"}],"sights":[{"description":"Well-preserved Roman amphitheatre about half an hour from Antalya.

A grandiose piece of art by Mimar Sinan, the Ottoman architect of 16th century, Selimiye is usually considered the zenith of Ottoman architecture and has been listed as a World Heritage site by UNESCO in 2011. Sinan himself considered this building as his best work. The dome of the building, which hangs high over main hall, encloses a huge space which gives the place an expansive atmosphere, had the largest diameter (31.28 m) of all domes in the world for several centuries. And its minarets (towers) are the second highest minarets (70.89 m) in the world, surpassed only by Qutb Minar (72.50 m) in Delhi, India. The mosque has 999 windows, which according to its architect, Sinan, symbolize the perfectness of God, through the imperfectness of the mosque he designed. The dome and interior walls are decorated with calligraphy and geometrical designs, most of which are painted in hues of pink and blue. If you have admired Blue Mosque (Sultanahmet Mosque) of Istanbul, you’ll adore this one, since Blue Mosque is quite a copy of Selimiye. The upside down tulips, which are some sort of symbol of Edirne have their origin in a tulip illustration engraved on a marble in the fountain right under the central dome of Selimiye. It is believed to symbolize the landlord of the tulip garden on which the mosque was built, who was said to be reluctant to give over his garden.","title":"Selimiye Mosque","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Selimiye_Mosque.png/93px-Selimiye_Mosque.png","thumbnail__source":"File:Selimiye_Mosque.png"},{"description":"The smallest—and the oldest—one of three nearby, imperial mosques in downtown Edirne is known for its calligraphic inscriptions on its interior walls with a small central dome atop.","title":"Old Mosque, Edirne","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Edirne_5232.jpg/120px-Edirne_5232.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Edirne_5232.jpg"},{"description":"This mosque is easily recognizable, having four distinctive minarets that all have very different designs, uncommon during the 15th century, one of which has three balconies, giving it its name which literally means \"three balconied\".

This is the largest of Odessa’s Orthodox cathedrals and was one of the Russian Empire’s grandest. The cathedral was designated the main church of New Russia in 1808 and was continuously expanded throughout the 19th century. The bell tower was built between 1825 and 1837, and the refectory connecting it to the main church several years later. The cathedral bells are controlled by an electronic device capable of playing 99 melodies. The interior was lined with polychrome marble, and the icon screen also was of marble. Several churches in the region, including the Nativity Cathedral in Chişinău, were built in conscious imitation of the Odessa church. The cathedral was the burial place of the bishops of Tauride (including Saint Innocent of Kherson) and Prince Mikhail Semyonovich Vorontsov, the famous governor of 'New Russia'. In the 1930s church was demolished by the communists and the graves were destroyed. In 1999, reconstruction began, and the reborn church was consecrated in 2003. Capacity: 12,000s.

Great for kids, the bus ride from/to central Cardiff is very pretty.","title":"St Fagans National Museum of History","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/St_Fagans_Castle_-_geograph.org.uk_-_524416.jpg/120px-St_Fagans_Castle_-_geograph.org.uk_-_524416.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:St_Fagans_Castle_-_geograph.org.uk_-_524416.jpg"},{"description":"The Hayes.

In addition, parts of the southwestern end of the canyon are within the borders of two Indian reservations: the Havasupai Indian Reservation and the Hualapai Indian Reservation (which includes the development known as Grand Canyon West). Lastly, part of the southeastern end of the canyon is within the borders of the Navajo Nation. Except for the Navajo Nation portion, all sections of the canyon offer amenities for visitors.

This trail traverses a seemingly unending series of switchbacks down the canyon wall before leveling out somewhat around the oasis of Indian Gardens. During the summer months water is available at the 1.5 mi (2.4 km) resthouse, the 3 mi (4.8 km) resthouse and Indian Gardens (4.5 mi or 7.2 km). However, check to ensure that the water is functioning before departing; water main breaks are common. Most hikers will traverse only a portion of this trail, and the park recommends that day hikers never attempt to go further than Indian Gardens. Winter hikers should note that the top two miles of this trail are likely to be icy. Round-trip distances to waypoints are: Mile-and-a-half Resthouse (3.0 mi/4.8 km with 1131 ft/345 m elevation change), Three-mile Resthouse (6.0 mi/9.6 km with 2112 ft/644 m elevation change), Indian Garden (9.8 mi/15.8 km with 3060 ft/933 m elevation change), River Resthouse (16.2 mi/26.2 km with 4380 ft/1337 m elevation change), Bright Angel Campground (19.2 mi/31.0 km with 4380 ft/1337 m elevation change).","title":"Bright Angel Trail","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Grand_Canyon_National_Park_-_South_-_03.jpg/120px-Grand_Canyon_National_Park_-_South_-_03.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Grand_Canyon_National_Park_-_South_-_03.jpg"},{"description":"Slightly steeper than the Bright Angel trail, this trail starts from Yaki Point and follows a ridgeline into the canyon. Because the trail follows a ridge the views are spectacular and wide-open, but the amazing scenery comes at a cost: there is almost no shade to protect hikers from the sun, and the lack of natural water sources means that there is less plant and animal life. Hikers should be aware that there is no water available along this trail and prepare for brutal conditions- summer hikes can be particularly dangerous. Round-trip distances to waypoints are: Cedar Ridge (3.0 mi/4.8 km with 1140 ft/348 m of elevation change), Skeleton Point (6.0 mi/9.6 km with 2040 ft/622 m of elevation change), the Tipoff (8.8 mi/14.2 km with 3260 ft/994 m of elevation change), Bright Angel Campground (14 mi/22.6 km with 4780 ft/1457 m of elevation change).","title":"South Kaibab Trail","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/South_Kaibab_Trail_October_2004.jpg/120px-South_Kaibab_Trail_October_2004.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:South_Kaibab_Trail_October_2004.jpg"},{"description":"This trail descends steeply from the North Kaibab Trailhead on the North Rim to Roaring Springs, the headwaters of Bright Angel Creek, where it flattens out for the long trek to the Colorado River. The upper stretch of the trail (from the trailhead to Cottonwood Campground) receives some shade, but the lower stretch to Bright Angel Campground becomes dangerously hot during the summer, and hiking between 10AM and 4PM should be avoided. During the summer, potable water is available at Supai Tunnel, Roaring Springs, and Cottonwood Campground; between Roaring Springs and the Colorado River, water from Bright Angel Creek can be purified for drinking purposes. Round-trip distances to waypoints are: Supai Tunnel (3.4 mi/5.0 km with 1440 ft/439 m of elevation change), Roaring Springs (9.4 mi/14.6 km with 3020 ft/920 m of elevation change), Cottonwood Campground (13.6 mi/21.8 km with 4160 ft/1268 m of elevation change, Bright Angel Campground (28 mi45 km with 5760 ft/1756 m of elevation change).","title":"North Kaibab Trail","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Ribbonfalls.jpg/120px-Ribbonfalls.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Ribbonfalls.jpg"},{"description":"This is a steep, marginally maintained, rocky trail that descends from the South Rim to the river, passing fossilized reptile tracks and abandoned camps from the early 1900s along the way.

Appropriate black dress is available at the mosque. You will avoid the queue for the clothing if you wear shoes, a long dress or trousers, and take a scarf to cover your head/hair.

The capital is also a great jumping off point for day trips to hot springs, old mining towns and national parks around the Northern Taiwan area.","thumbnail":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Taipei%2C_Taiwan_CBD_Skyline.jpg/560px-Taipei%2C_Taiwan_CBD_Skyline.jpg","thumbnail__source":"Taipei%2C_Taiwan_CBD_Skyline.jpg","links":[{"href":"http://www.railway.gov.tw/en/","text":"Taiwan Railway Administration"},{"href":"http://www.thsrc.com.tw/index_en.html","text":"Taiwan High Speed Rail"},{"href":"http://www.taiwancsf.com/default.aspx","text":"CSF"},{"href":"http://www.taiwancsf.com/Content.aspx?sn=7","text":"full schedule"},{"href":"http://www.taiwancsf.com/content.aspx?sn=149","text":"fare table"},{"href":"http://www.taiwancsf.com/content.aspx?sn=158","text":"advance"},{"href":"http://www.taiwancsf.com/content.aspx?sn=159","text":"pier"},{"href":"http://www.e-bus.taipei.gov.tw/","text":"e-bus"}],"sights":[{"description":"memorial hall in Taipei","title":"Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Chiang_Kai-shek_memorial_amk.jpg/120px-Chiang_Kai-shek_memorial_amk.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Chiang_Kai-shek_memorial_amk.jpg"},{"description":"district of Taipei","title":"Zhongzheng District","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Chiang_Kai-shek_memorial_amk.jpg/120px-Chiang_Kai-shek_memorial_amk.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Chiang_Kai-shek_memorial_amk.jpg"},{"description":"district in New Taipei City","title":"Xindian District","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Taiwan_2009_Taipei_Xindian_FRD_7087.jpg/120px-Taiwan_2009_Taipei_Xindian_FRD_7087.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Taiwan_2009_Taipei_Xindian_FRD_7087.jpg"},{"description":"skyscraper located in Xinyi District, Taipei, Taiwan","title":"Taipei 101","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Sun_Down_%28250260941%29.jpeg/72px-Sun_Down_%28250260941%29.jpeg","thumbnail__source":"File:Sun_Down_(250260941).jpeg"},{"description":"national museum in Taipei","title":"National Palace Museum","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/NationalPalace_MuseumFrontView.jpg/120px-NationalPalace_MuseumFrontView.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:NationalPalace_MuseumFrontView.jpg"},{"description":"museum in Taipei, Taiwan","title":"National Museum of History","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/ROC_National_Museum_of_History_Seal.svg/118px-ROC_National_Museum_of_History_Seal.svg.png","thumbnail__source":"File:ROC_National_Museum_of_History_Seal.svg"},{"description":"art museum in Taipei","title":"Taipei Fine Arts Museum","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Taipei_Fine_Arts_Museum_20150919.jpg/120px-Taipei_Fine_Arts_Museum_20150919.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Taipei_Fine_Arts_Museum_20150919.jpg"},{"description":"zoo","title":"Taipei Zoo","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Taipei_zoo01.jpg/120px-Taipei_zoo01.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Taipei_zoo01.jpg"},{"description":"A water park in Taipei","title":"Taipei Water Park","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Taipei_Water_Park_entrance_20160101.jpg/120px-Taipei_Water_Park_entrance_20160101.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Taipei_Water_Park_entrance_20160101.jpg"},{"description":"city in Taiwan","title":"New Taipei City","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/New_Taipei_montage.png/89px-New_Taipei_montage.png","thumbnail__source":"File:New_Taipei_montage.png"},{"title":"Bitan","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Bitan_Xindian_Taiwan.jpg/120px-Bitan_Xindian_Taiwan.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Bitan_Xindian_Taiwan.jpg"}],"climate":[{"heading":"Jan","precipitation":83,"high":19,"low":13},{"heading":"Feb","precipitation":170,"high":19,"low":14},{"heading":"Mar","precipitation":180,"high":22,"low":15},{"heading":"Apr","precipitation":178,"high":26,"low":19},{"heading":"May","precipitation":235,"high":29,"low":22},{"heading":"Jun","precipitation":326,"high":32,"low":24},{"heading":"Jul","precipitation":245,"high":35,"low":26},{"heading":"Aug","precipitation":322,"high":34,"low":26},{"heading":"Sep","precipitation":361,"high":31,"low":24},{"heading":"Oct","precipitation":149,"high":28,"low":22},{"heading":"Nov","precipitation":83,"high":24,"low":19},{"heading":"Dec","precipitation":73,"high":21,"low":15}]},"Kampala":{"lat":0.3,"lon":32.633333,"title":"Kampala","summary":"Kampala, the City of Seven Hills, is the capital city of Uganda and is, by a very large margin, the largest city in the country.

The final mile is a grueling trek up granite steps, followed by wire cables that lead up the steep ascent to the top of Half Dome. Hikers should bring leather work gloves to protect their hands from the cables; some gloves are often available in a pile at the bottom of the cables. While it is possible to ascend Half Dome while the cables are down (between approximately October 15 and May 15), hikers do so at their own risk. Views and scenery are unforgettable, but hikers should be aware that the final climb up the back side of Half Dome via the cables can be exhausting and, for those with even a mild fear of heights, frightening. While the majority of the trail is accessible without a permit, an $8 permit is required to traverse the final stretch of the trail beyond the base of the Half Dome subdome. 300 permits are available each day (approximately 225 to hikers and 75 to backpackers), with rangers stationed on the trail to turn away hikers without permits. Permits can be obtained in advance via a pre-season lottery (apply online between March 1 and March 31, permits issued in mid-April, an additional online application fee of $4.50 applies), and approximately 50 permits are made available in an evening lottery two days prior to the hiking date.","title":"Half Dome","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Half_Dome_from_Glacier_Point%2C_Yosemite_NP_-_Diliff.jpg/120px-Half_Dome_from_Glacier_Point%2C_Yosemite_NP_-_Diliff.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Half_Dome_from_Glacier_Point,_Yosemite_NP_-_Diliff.jpg"},{"description":"waterfall in Yosemite","title":"Bridalveil Fall","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Bridelveil_Falls_Yosemite.jpg/120px-Bridelveil_Falls_Yosemite.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Bridelveil_Falls_Yosemite.jpg"},{"description":"waterfall","title":"Elizabeth Lake (Yosemite National Park)","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/Firstbloom_Yosemite_Campout_2014_%2814444518928%29.jpg/120px-Firstbloom_Yosemite_Campout_2014_%2814444518928%29.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Firstbloom_Yosemite_Campout_2014_(14444518928).jpg"},{"description":"lake in Mariposa County, California, United States of America","title":"Ostrander Lake","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Ostrander_side.jpg/120px-Ostrander_side.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Ostrander_side.jpg"},{"title":"Taft Point","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/Taft_Point_Panorama.jpg/120px-Taft_Point_Panorama.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Taft_Point_Panorama.jpg"},{"description":"granite dome in Yosemite National Park","title":"Sentinel Dome","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Sentinel_Dome%2C_Yosemite_NP.jpg/120px-Sentinel_Dome%2C_Yosemite_NP.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Sentinel_Dome,_Yosemite_NP.jpg"},{"description":"mountain in United States of America","title":"Lembert Dome","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Lembert_dome.JPG/120px-Lembert_dome.JPG","thumbnail__source":"File:Lembert_dome.JPG"},{"title":"Glen Aulin","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/Glen_Aulin.jpg/116px-Glen_Aulin.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Glen_Aulin.jpg"},{"title":"Cathedral Lakes","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Cathedral_Peak_and_Lake_in_Yosemite.jpg/120px-Cathedral_Peak_and_Lake_in_Yosemite.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Cathedral_Peak_and_Lake_in_Yosemite.jpg"},{"description":"Mountain Pass of Sierra Nevada, in California","title":"Mono Pass","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Mono_Pass_winter_from_east.jpg/120px-Mono_Pass_winter_from_east.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Mono_Pass_winter_from_east.jpg"},{"description":"waterfall","title":"Wapama Falls","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Wapama_Falls.JPG/90px-Wapama_Falls.JPG","thumbnail__source":"File:Wapama_Falls.JPG"}],"climate":[{"heading":"Jan","precipitation":165.1,"high":8.9,"low":-1.7},{"heading":"Feb","precipitation":170.2,"high":11.1,"low":-1.1},{"heading":"Mar","precipitation":132.1,"high":14.4,"low":1.1},{"heading":"Apr","precipitation":71.1,"high":17.8,"low":3.3},{"heading":"May","precipitation":43.2,"high":21.7,"low":7.2},{"heading":"Jun","precipitation":17.8,"high":27.2,"low":10.6},{"heading":"Jul","precipitation":10.2,"high":31.7,"low":13.9},{"heading":"Aug","precipitation":2.5,"high":31.7,"low":13.3},{"heading":"Sep","precipitation":17.8,"high":27.8,"low":10.6},{"heading":"Oct","precipitation":53.3,"high":21.7,"low":5.6},{"heading":"Nov","precipitation":116.8,"high":13.3,"low":0.6},{"heading":"Dec","precipitation":139.7,"high":8.3,"low":-2.2}]},"Seattle":{"lat":47.6032,"lon":-122.3303,"title":"Seattle","summary":"Seattle, Washington sits at one of the most beautiful spots in the United States.

The columns in the western portico leading to the narthex, however, are styled with muqarnas, showing eastern Anatolian influences. The use of arches, freezes and muqarnas is atypical for Byzantine churches. The church has a freestanding square bell tower, which is unique among churches of the Black Sea region. It houses a small chapel on its second floor. Invisible from its exterior, the internal walls of the bell tower are covered in frescoes. There is a peaceful open-air tea garden on the grounds. Just north of the church the foundation of a previous chapel can be seen. While the main hall of the church was converted into a mosque in 2013 (its legal status is still under debate), all of the best preserved frescoes are still visible in the narthex. In December 2017 it was announced that the building will be renovated again, making all the frescoes and Opus Sectile floor mosaics visible to tourists.","title":"Hagia Sophia, Trabzon","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Ayasofyatrabzon.jpg/120px-Ayasofyatrabzon.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Ayasofyatrabzon.jpg"},{"description":"According to an inscription on the facade, this small basilican church was restored in the 9th century.

Because the Cavalry only expected to be here a short while, they built a temporary post near the base of the Terraces called Camp Sheridan. After five cold, harsh winters, they realized that their stay in the park was going to be longer than expected, so they built Fort Yellowstone, a permanent post. In 1891, the first building to be constructed was the guard house because it directly coincided with the Cavalry's mission - protection and management. By 1916, the National Park Service was established, and the Cavalry gave control of Yellowstone back to the civilians. Since that time, historic Fort Yellowstone has been Yellowstone's headquarters.","title":"Fort Yellowstone","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Fort_Yellowstone_Circa_1910.jpg/120px-Fort_Yellowstone_Circa_1910.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Fort_Yellowstone_Circa_1910.jpg"},{"description":"The first major entrance for Yellowstone was at the north boundary. Robert Reamer, a famous architect in Yellowstone, designed the immense stone arch for coaches to travel through on their way into the park. At the time of the arch's construction, President Theodore Roosevelt was visiting the park. He consequently placed the cornerstone for the arch, which then took his name. The top of the Roosevelt Arch is inscribed with \"For the benefit and enjoyment of the people,\" which is from the Organic Act of 1916.","title":"Roosevelt Arch","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Yellowstone_North_Gate.jpg/120px-Yellowstone_North_Gate.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Yellowstone_North_Gate.jpg"},{"description":"town","title":"Mammoth Hot Springs","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Dead_trees_at_Mammoth_Hot_Springs.jpg/120px-Dead_trees_at_Mammoth_Hot_Springs.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Dead_trees_at_Mammoth_Hot_Springs.jpg"},{"description":"Along the Northeast Entrance Road east of Tower Junction, this area contains the largest concentration of petrified trees in the world.

Buffalo ranching operations continued at Lamar until the 1950s. The valley was irrigated for hay pastures, and corrals and fencing were scattered throughout the area. Four remaining buildings from the original ranch compound are contained within the Lamar Buffalo Ranch Historic District (two residences, the bunkhouse, and the barn) and are on the National Register of Historic Places. Visitors can drive by to view the historic buffalo ranch, however, there are no facilities open to the general public at this location.","title":"Lamar Buffalo Ranch","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Lamar_Buffalo_Ranch_in_landscape.jpg/120px-Lamar_Buffalo_Ranch_in_landscape.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Lamar_Buffalo_Ranch_in_landscape.jpg"},{"description":"The Northeast Entrance Ranger Station was constructed in 1934-35 and is a National Historic Landmark.

It is an excellent place to look for grizzly bears, particularly in the spring and early summer when they may be preying upon newborn bison and elk calves. Large herds of bison may be viewed in the spring, early summer, and during the fall rut, which usually begins late July to early August. Coyotes can almost always be seen in the valley. Bird life is abundant in and along the river. A variety of shore birds may be seen in the mud flats at Alum Creek. A pair of sandhill cranes usually nests at the south end of the valley. Ducks, geese, and American white pelicans cruise the river. The valley is also an excellent place to look for bald eagles and northern harriers.","title":"Hayden Valley","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/HaydenValley1977JSchmidt.jpg/120px-HaydenValley1977JSchmidt.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:HaydenValley1977JSchmidt.jpg"},{"description":"Mt. Washburn is the main peak in the Washburn Range, rising 10,243 ft (3,122 m) above the west side of the canyon. It is the remnant of volcanic activity that took place long before the formation of the present canyon. Mt. Washburn was named for Gen. Henry Dana Washburn, leader of the 1870 Washburn-Langford-Doane Expedition. One of the best places in the park for spotting bighorn sheep and also a great spot for wildflowers, a trail leads up the mountain to a lookout tower near the 10,243-foot (3,122 m) summit. The altitude may affect some hikers, so it is best to be acclimatized to the higher elevation before attempting this hike. In addition, bring extra layers, even in the summer, since the top can be windy and cold.","title":"Mount Washburn","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/YELLOWSTONE-2014_98.jpg/120px-YELLOWSTONE-2014_98.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:YELLOWSTONE-2014_98.jpg"},{"description":"cascade type waterfall in Yellowstone National Park","title":"Mystic Falls","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Mystic_Falls_Yellowstone.JPG/80px-Mystic_Falls_Yellowstone.JPG","thumbnail__source":"File:Mystic_Falls_Yellowstone.JPG"},{"description":"waterfall","title":"Osprey Falls","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/PSM_V40_D472_Osprey_falls_of_gardiner_river.jpg/72px-PSM_V40_D472_Osprey_falls_of_gardiner_river.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:PSM_V40_D472_Osprey_falls_of_gardiner_river.jpg"},{"description":"mountain in United States of America","title":"Sepulcher Mountain","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/SepulcherMountainYNP2009.jpg/120px-SepulcherMountainYNP2009.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:SepulcherMountainYNP2009.jpg"},{"description":"Lake in Park County, Wyoming, USA","title":"Grebe Lake","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/GrebeLakeYNP.jpg/120px-GrebeLakeYNP.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:GrebeLakeYNP.jpg"}],"climate":[{"heading":"Jan","precipitation":53.3,"high":-2.2,"low":-17.8},{"heading":"Feb","precipitation":50.8,"high":0,"low":-17.2},{"heading":"Mar","precipitation":55.9,"high":3.9,"low":-12.2},{"heading":"Apr","precipitation":55.9,"high":7.8,"low":-7.2},{"heading":"May","precipitation":71.1,"high":12.8,"low":-2.2},{"heading":"Jun","precipitation":63.5,"high":18.3,"low":1.7},{"heading":"Jul","precipitation":40.6,"high":23.9,"low":4.4},{"heading":"Aug","precipitation":38.1,"high":23.3,"low":2.8},{"heading":"Sep","precipitation":38.1,"high":17.8,"low":-1.7},{"heading":"Oct","precipitation":43.2,"high":10,"low":-5.6},{"heading":"Nov","precipitation":58.4,"high":1.7,"low":-12.2},{"heading":"Dec","precipitation":81.3,"high":-3.3,"low":-17.8}]},"New York City":{"lat":40.719,"lon":-74.002,"title":"New York City","summary":"One of the world's greatest cities, New York (known as \"The Big Apple\", \"NYC,\" and often called \"New York City\") is a global center for media, entertainment, art, fashion, research, finance, and trade.

Against his wishes, but that's how it goes. No talking, revealing clothing (shorts should be knee length and no exposed shoulders), or other signs of disrespect allowed while viewing; photos are allowed only from outside, in the grand Ba Dinh Square. Purses are allowed into the tomb, but expect them to be searched by several bored soldiers along the way. Left luggage is handled in a complicated scheme: there is an office near the street for large bags, with separate windows for Vietnamese and foreigners, and a further office for cameras, which will be transported to a third office right outside the exit of the mausoleum. Items checked in at the first office, however, will stay there. The mausoleum is closed for a couple months around the end of the year, when the body is taken abroad for maintenance. It is closed in the afternoons for maintenance.","title":"Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Ho_Chi_Minh_Mausoleum_from_the_front.JPG/120px-Ho_Chi_Minh_Mausoleum_from_the_front.JPG","thumbnail__source":"File:Ho_Chi_Minh_Mausoleum_from_the_front.JPG"},{"description":"Visitors find this either charming and lovely or utterly pointless, depending on how many tour groups are crammed into the small grounds at the time of their visit. It has a long history attached to it. Regarded as one of Vietnam's iconic temples, it was built by Emperor Lý Thái Tông. The emperor was childless and dreamt that he met the bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara, who handed him a baby son while seated on a lotus flower. He then married a peasant girl that he had met and she bore him a son. The emperor constructed the temple in gratitude for this in 1049 having been told by a monk to build the temple, by erecting a pillar in the middle of a lotus pond, similar to the one he saw in the dream. Before the pagoda was opened, prayers were held for the longevity of the monarch. The temple is built of wood on a single stone pillar 1.25 m in diameter, and it is designed to resemble a lotus blossom, which is a Buddhist symbol of purity, since a lotus blossoms in a muddy pond. In 1954, the French Union forces destroyed the pagoda before withdrawing from Vietnam after the First Indochina War, it was rebuilt afterwards.","title":"One Pillar Pagoda","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Chua_Mot_Cot.jpg/120px-Chua_Mot_Cot.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Chua_Mot_Cot.jpg"},{"description":"This gleaming white museum and its gloriously ham-handed iconography is the perfect chaser to the solemnity of the mausoleum. The building, completed in 1990, is intended to evoke a white lotus. Some photos and old letters are on display on the second floor, but the main exhibition space is on the third floor. It includes cars crashing through walls to represent the chaos of post-war American capitalism, soldiers charging around with electric plugs, a cave hideout re-imagined as the inside of Ho Chi Minh's brain, and several other postmodern confections integrated with the detailed main story of the man's life and his country's struggle. There are plenty of photographs, prison documents and newspaper cuttings tracing his life along the way. The tour ends with a burnt bridge signifying the separation of Vietnam, followed by a reconstructed bridge showing the unification of Vietnam after the war. One of the more informative museums in Vietnam. Free guides are available in English, French, Chinese and Russian. The displays are labelled in English and French.","title":"Ho Chi Minh Museum","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/Ho_Chi_Minh_museum%2C_Hanoi_2.jpg/120px-Ho_Chi_Minh_museum%2C_Hanoi_2.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Ho_Chi_Minh_museum,_Hanoi_2.jpg"},{"description":"The exit from the mausoleum takes you right into the grounds of the, uh, vestige, where Ho Chi Minh lived and worked from 1954 until his death in 1969. The nicely landscaped complex includes two of Ho Chi Minh's houses, kept shiny and \"as he left them\" by the authorities, as well as a garage with two of Ho's \"used cars\" and a carp-filled pond. You also get to see Ho Chi Minh's work room and politburo meeting room The presidential palace is nearby, but it's not always open to visitors.

It's the locals' favorite leisure spot, and a great place to watch people practising tai chi in the morning or to sit and read in the afternoon. At weekends the park becomes even more popular as the normally busy road around it is pedestrianised, and instead filled with children driving electric cars or riding hoverboards. Hoan Kiem means \"returned sword\", and the name comes from a legend in which King Le Loi was given a magical sword by the gods, which he used to drive out the invading Chinese. Later, while boating on the lake, he encountered a giant turtle, which grabbed the sword and carried it down to its depths, returning it to the gods from whom it had come. (You can see a version of the legend at the Water Puppet Theatre.) The giant soft-shell turtles, whom Vietnamese biologists assigned to a separate species, Rafetus leloii, resided in the lake until the early 21st century. One of them, who died in 1968, has been preserved by the wonders of taxidermy, and can be viewed in a glass box (sarcophagus?) in a pavilion adjacent to Ngoc Son Temple on the island in the lake.","title":"Hoàn Kiếm Lake","thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Th%C3%A1p_R%C3%B9a_3.jpg/120px-Th%C3%A1p_R%C3%B9a_3.jpg","thumbnail__source":"File:Tháp_Rùa_3.jpg"},{"description":"Mostly a residential hub of the well-to-do.

This is where the French imprisoned and executed Vietnamese freedom fighters. It is now a museum since two thirds of the prison was torn down to make way for the Hanoi Towers, the museum exhibits the plight of the jailed political revolutionaries, their plight under the French colonial regime and the struggle of the Vietnamese people against imperialism in chilling detail. The prison was also known as the \"Hanoi Hilton\" during the Vietnam War as it held US POWs. Little emphasis is given to this period however, and to some the exhibits may seem to be propaganda, such as showing photos only of prisoners being treated well and playing basketball and playing chess. The museum claims to have John McCain's flight suit from when his plane was shot down. Most of the exhibits are self-explanatory in English and a guide may not be required.
