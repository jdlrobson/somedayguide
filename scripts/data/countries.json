Since 1967, Israel has controlled most of the West Bank (often called \"Judea and Samaria\" in Israel) as well as the Golan Heights. Israel has annexed East Jerusalem and the Golan, but most other countries, except the United States, reject the annexation, and consider these areas and the West Bank (which Israel did not annex, and Israeli law does not apply to the area) to be occupied Palestinian territory. Wikivoyage takes no stance on these political issues, but notes that in practice, current visitors to these areas will need Israeli visas and permits.","airports":["TLV","ETM"],"sights":["Dome of the Rock","Western Wall","Church of the Holy Sepulchre","Nimrod, Golan Heights","Galilee","Sea of Galilee","Nabi Shu'ayb","City of David","Hatzor","Ramla","Negev","Dead Sea","Eurasia","Yad Vashem","Israel National Trail","Judaean Desert"],"links":[{"href":"http://www.louiscruises.com/","text":"Louis Cruises"},{"href":"http://www.salamis-tours.com/","text":"Salamis Cruises"},{"href":"https://cruise.mano.co.il/?lan=en-US","text":"Mano Cruise"},{"href":"http://www.haifaport.co.il/","text":"Haifa Port"},{"href":"http://www.ashdodport.co.il/","text":"Ashdod Port"},{"href":"http://www.herzliya-marina.co.il","text":"Herzliya"},{"href":"http://www.telaviv-marina.co.il","text":"Tel Aviv"},{"href":"http://www.egged.co.il/Eng/","text":"Egged"},{"href":"http://www.rail.co.il/en","text":"Israel Railways"}],"destinations":["Jerusalem","Akko","Beer Sheva","Eilat","Haifa","Nazareth","Safed","Tel Aviv","Tiberias","Jerusalem/Old City","Sea of Galilee region","Dead Sea (Israel)","Jezreel Valley","Judaean Desert","Masada","Sde Boker","Caesarea","Beth Shean Valley","Lower Galilee","Golan Heights","Rosh Haniqra","Mitzpe Ramon","Mount Hermon","Carmel Range","Dead Sea (Israel and the West Bank)","Beit Shean Valley"]},"Italy":{"thumbnail":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Vue_des_toits_depuis_la_Sainte-Trinit%C3%A9-des-Monts%2C_Rome%2C_Italy.jpg/500px-Vue_des_toits_depuis_la_Sainte-Trinit%C3%A9-des-Monts%2C_Rome%2C_Italy.jpg","thumbnail__source":"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Vue_des_toits_depuis_la_Sainte-Trinit%C3%A9-des-Monts%2C_Rome%2C_Italy.jpg","lat":42.5,"lon":12.5,"title":"Italy","summary":"   \nItaly (Italian: Italia), officially the Italian Republic (Repubblica italiana), is a country in Southern Europe, occupying the Italian Peninsula and the Po Valley south of the Alps.
