With more than 260 million people, Indonesia is the fourth most populous country in the world — after China, India and the USA — and by far the largest in Southeast Asia. While it has land borders with Malaysia to the north and East Timor and Papua New Guinea to the east, its exclusive economic zone also abuts Australia to the south; Palau, the Philippines, Vietnam, Singapore, and Thailand to the north; and India to the northwest. With an extensive, but quickly carved out amount of green forests on all of its islands and half way between the poles, Indonesia is nicknamed The Emerald of the Equator.","airports":["DPS","CGK"],"sights":["Sulawesi","Ujung Kulon National Park","Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park","Lorentz National Park","Padang","Nias","Sumbawa","Baliem Valley","Lake Toba","Sipisopiso","Kenyah people","Kayan people (Borneo)","Jakarta History Museum","Istiqlal Mosque, Jakarta","Taman Suropati","Kalijodo Park","Taman Mini Indonesia Indah","Gelora Bung Karno Stadium","Dago, Bandung","Bandung Institute of Technology","Gedung Sate","Lembang","Sultan Suriansyah Mosque","Lake Sentani","Tanah Lot","Fort Rotterdam","Maha Vihara Maitreya","Great Mosque of Medan","Maimun Palace","East Java","Ganjuran Church","Kotagede","Taman Sari (Yogyakarta)","Sari temple","Sonobudoyo Museum","Prambanan","Magelang","Mount Bromo","Mount Batok","Semeru","Pura Ulun Danu Bratan","Pura Luhur Batukaru","Ubud","Bedugul","Mount Rinjani","Mount Batur","Mount Agung","West Java","Demak, Demak","South Sulawesi","Pangandaran","Central Java","Semarang","Dieng Plateau","Sumba","Nusa Penida","Gili Islands","Kuta (Lombok)","Lake Kerinci","Lake Gunung Tujuh","Mount Kerinci","Parangtritis","Mount Merapi","Kintamani, Bali","Pura Ulun Danu Batur","Bukit Peninsula","Legian","Tirta Gangga","Denpasar","Tulamben","Menjangan Island","Canggu","Nusa Dua","West Bali National Park","Toraja","Cheng Ho Mosque","Gereja Ayam"],"links":[{"href":"http://www.pelni.co.id","text":"PELNI"},{"href":"http://www.kereta-api.co.id/","text":"PT Kereta Api"},{"href":"http://www.damri.co.id","text":"DAMRI"},{"href":"https://www.bosbis.com/en","text":"bosbis.com"}],"destinations":["Jakarta","Bandung","Banjarmasin","Jayapura","Kuta","Makassar","Medan","Surabaya","Yogyakarta","Borobudur","Bromo-Tengger-Semeru National Park","Bunaken","Kerinci Seblat National Park","Komodo National Park","Lombok","Tana Toraja","Bintan","Batam","Bali"],"wb":"Q252","neighbors":["East Timor","Malaysia","Papua New Guinea","Singapore","Philippines","Australia","Thailand","India","Palau","Vietnam"],"commons":"Indonesia"},"Iran":{"thumbnail":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Yazd_panorama.jpg/440px-Yazd_panorama.jpg","thumbnail__source":"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Yazd_panorama.jpg","lat":32,"lon":53,"title":"Iran","summary":"Iran (Persian: ایران) is a large country between the Gulf of Oman, the Persian Gulf, and the Caspian Sea.
