During the Classic Period it was one of the largest and most important of the Mayan cities. Today it's one of the most fascinating and enjoyable of the Mayan sites to visit, largely due to its remoteness, but also its jungle setting. Tourists still descend on it by the busload, but it's far from feeling overrun like Chichen Itza and other sites. Some of the temples are still being uncovered, and you can watch archaeologists busy at work. It was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1979.</p>","thumbnail__source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/Tikal_Temple4_2006_08_11.JPG","description":"Ruins of major ancient Maya city"},{"title":"San Francisco","lat":37.7857,"lon":-122.4061,"thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Aerial_view_of_San_Francisco_International_Airport_2010.jpg/320px-Aerial_view_of_San_Francisco_International_Airport_2010.jpg","summary":"<p>The centerpiece of the Bay Area, <b><span class=\"external text\">San Francisco</span></b> is one of the most visited cities in the world, and with good reason.
